<PRE>Hey everybody. We at Chia are working on a new cryptocurrency and are
planning on making BLS be the standard way all signatures are done in it
because we like the noninteractive aggregation and unique signatures
features.

To that end, we're implementing them using the Relic library based on
BLS12-381. Er, sort of. It turns out that BLS12-381 as defined has 96 byte
public keys and 48 byte signatures, on the theory that usually public keys
are published once and then used to sign many things. In cryptocurrencies
it's the opposite, where public keys are published once and used to sign a
fraction of one thing because signatures are aggregated. To that end we're
swapping the curves around, so the public keys are 48 bytes and the
signatures are 96 bytes.

Our implementation is meant to be mostly api compatible with Bitcoin's
Key.cpp except that we don't support non-compact signatures and don't have
salt. Features we have or are working on include basic verification,
aggregation, compact multisig, and SecureAllocator support, and maybe some
more things I don't remember off the top of my head. Eventually we plan to
swap out Relic for something constant time.
