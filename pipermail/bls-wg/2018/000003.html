I think it's totally fine if you want to use G1 for public keys, but
I'm still confused about the language you're using to describe
BLS12-381.

The title of this thread (&quot;Reverse BLS12-381&quot;) and &quot;It turns out that
BLS12-381 as defined has 96 byte public keys and 48 byte signatures&quot;
are both inaccurate. BLS12-381 doesn't define what a public key is or
what a signature is because it's a curve construction, not a signature
scheme.

I just want to make sure others aren't confused because these are
easily confusable names. Carry on!
