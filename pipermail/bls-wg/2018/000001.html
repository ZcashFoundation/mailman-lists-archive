<PRE>Hi,

BLS12-381 is so-named because it's from the Barreto&#8211;Lynn&#8211;Scott family
of curves. BLS signatures are so-named because it's a
Boneh&#8211;Lynn&#8211;Shacham signature scheme. It's usually the case that
pairing friendly curves have a short group encoding (G1) and a longer
group encoding (G2).

I would caution saying &quot;swapping the curves&quot; because it may indicate
you're changing the curve construction when you're actually just
changing the signature scheme. BLS12-381 doesn't define anything about
how you use them for BLS signature schemes, or which group you use for
the key or the signature.

I'm excited to see BLS signatures finally end up in a cryptocurrency.
Besides what group you use for the signature, it'll be important to
specify how you're hashing to that group (for BLS signatures). We've
been having discussions about this in my pairing library and in
another library. I'd like to see everyone using the same
well-specified technique to hash to the curve; hopefully this weekend
I'll have a spec fleshed out and we'll have test vectors for
inter-operability. It seems possible we could have this merged into
RELIC as well.
