<PRE>Hello all,

As you may have seen I delayed sharing my attestation until now (after
the amazing one by Ryan and Andrew), having shared the hash commitment
with Sean on Friday 19th at about 10:30am EST. Attached the text file.

sha256 of attestation file:
807dbdab834438008f6732898e33b4ffcc623833b3d46faaf665ca1d7e31bd5e

PS: I hope the attestation does not cause any negative reaction :)

Here is the signature of the sha256 (public key available in MIT PGP server):

Powers of TAU Operetional writeup
=================================

Round: 40

SHA256 challenge file: 73e4aac6895fd457ffe6946a6fcd1d0eef88f77b6daebd6348ee19e629c7de13

Blake2b response file: 
The BLAKE2b hash of `./response` is:

Preparation steps
=================

Initially I wanted to ensure a secure execution environment so I took an old ASUS 64bit with an Intel Core i3-3217U with 1.8 GHz and a 4GB DDR3 RAM. It had Windows 8 installed and I rebooted it from an USB drive with the latest stable Ubuntu 16.04.

I planned on removing the unnesessary hardware and isolate the machine, to then destroy the memory for unrecoverability of the randomness. Then, I realized that this is round 40 and that most of the executions actually took the time and effort (good job everyone!) to implement such practical security properties. So I felt like (given that I am less of an engineer and more theoretically oriented) I wanted to emphasize more the theoretical security aspects of this powers of tau construction, giving some extra recognition to the authors. 

Hence I decided to become a (limited) adversarial player in this MPC computation by allowing for the low-hanging-fruit vulnerabilities. First I computed the response file while connected to the internet and shared on twitter the fact that I was computing the response file from a given IP address while connected to the internet.

Second, here is the exact entropy I added to the computation when asked by the program: &quot;this is my randomness for powers of tau&quot;, which reduces the computing effort needed to recover the rest of the entropy used for the random generator.

Post-processing
===============

Third, I have not erased any of the challenge or response files, nor cleared my memory, which I believe *should* have enough information to recover my share of randomness to the accumulator. If I had thought of this previously I would have changed the source code to print out my share (maybe someone wants to do it).

As a final note, my purpose is clearly not to sabotage the MPC ceremony, but to reinforce the fact that its secure execution relies mostly on the cryptographic security of the scheme and not on the practical security features of the execution. Given that at least one of the participants performed the steps properly and erased any trace without having been intercepted, the non-encoded powers of tau vector should not be recoverable and hence soundness of the SNARK will still hold. I believe that there has already been at least one such instance, so if anyone wants to recover my share, feel free.
