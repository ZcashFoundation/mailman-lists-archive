Just to clarify a few things:

The parameter generation ceremony has two rounds (the first one is called
&quot;powers of tau&quot;).  The resulting parameters will be used in the upcoming Zcash
&quot;Sapling&quot; upgrade.

We are *not* accepting any new participants for the first round for this
particular parameter generation ceremony.  The random beacon has already been
announced and sampled (this is the final part of the first round) and we want
to move on to the second round as soon as possible.

As for the second round, you would be welcome to participate when that gets
started.  Details have not been announced yet.

Finally, we will probably continue with a &quot;fork&quot; of the first round to make it
even stronger by adding more participants, so that it can be used to generate
parameters for other projects (but not Zcash Sapling), assuming there is
sufficient interest.  I will post an announcement to the list soon if we get
this set up.

Hope that helps,
