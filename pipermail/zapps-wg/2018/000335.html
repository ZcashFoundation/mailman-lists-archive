<PRE>Hi all!

I've completed my portion of the ceremony.
The setup was:

    - 15&quot; Macbook Pro 2016
    - Fresh installation of MacOS 10.12.6
    - Processor:  2.6 GHz Core i7 (I7-6700HQ)

How it was made:

Downloaded the challenge file and Rust source code on seperate computer.  
Disconnected from internet and unplugged router.  All wireless devices were shut off.  Compiled Rust source code.  Used wiped USB flash drive to transfer binary and challenge file to Macbook Pro running a new MacOS install that hadn't been connected to internet since new OS install, where computation was done.  Flash drive was used to move response back to original computer from where it was uploaded.

Randomness:
    - Many dice rolls
    - SHA256 of video recording of me making funny faces
    - Keyboard smashing

The file was transferred and upload from another machine.

Had some trouble to uploading file to amazon instance, so uploaded to Jason directly, who will upload on my behalf.  My response file can be found at <A HREF="ipfs://QmXE4L7j2vtja9kNo3uhq3TPSExK8QkxtGhkSoLxPQ4rea">ipfs://QmXE4L7j2vtja9kNo3uhq3TPSExK8QkxtGhkSoLxPQ4rea</A> 

The BLAKE2b hash of my response is:
9b142f13 cc68e096 196fd137 f125bb0e

74218f7f 3f733c77 42df23fe 501da481

I have publicly tweeted these:  <A HREF="https://twitter.com/sunnya97/status/974323886962683905">https://twitter.com/sunnya97/status/974323886962683905</A>

Special thanks to Jason for all his help!

&gt;<i> Hello! I have uploaded the file.

</I>&gt;<i> I used a HP Elitebook 2560, and the Go implementation of Powers of Tau by Filosottile, run on a Centos 7 minimal. I mixed some own entropy to /dev/random.

</I>&gt;<i> I have used a separate network and compute node, the letter stripped from WiFi, Bluetooth, modem and internal hard drive, booted from SD card.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The computation and the entropy mixing happened in a remote agricultural building with electricity inside.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Files were transferred between nodes via USB with checking the files integrity. Download took 20 minutes and compute around 2.5 hours on the 2 core CPU.

</I>&gt;<i> Upload took nearly two hours, and was done with dropbox because the connection to aws broke several times, probably this has something to do with

</I>&gt;<i> The contribution happened from a small village : Ozm&#225;nb&#252;k, Hungary.

</I>&gt;<i> This was my second participation after November when I took part with running the Rust implementation.
