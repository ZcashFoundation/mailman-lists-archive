<PRE>The Powers of Tau security proof (see
<A HREF="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050</A>) holds in the &quot;random beacon model,&quot;
meaning that we must apply a random beacon at the end of the ceremony.
It's not good enough to use (say) a hash of the transcript, because of
adaptive attacks (the last participant could predict the beacon
output). We must apply a beacon that is queried after the ceremony has
completed.

There is some good news on this front:

1. We *can* query reasonably secure beacons. More on that later.
2. Even if the beacon is partially controlled by an adversary, we only
lose a bit of security for every bit of the beacon output that is
influenced by the adversary. This means our beacon could be somewhat
broken and we'll live in acceptable security bounds.
3. Even if the beacon is _totally_ insecure, it may not even matter
because we may be able to prove the MPC is secure using the same
assumptions the proving system itself uses. We haven't had time to
write a security proof of this yet.
4. Even if we choose a _totally_ insecure beacon, you can just apply
your own beacon instead (one that you're more confident in, or perhaps
the result of a random coinflip protocol depending on what you're
doing).

But, let's choose a pretty good beacon anyway. Some notes on that:

* There is a large space of possible choices for a beacon, so it's
important that we choose the most obvious and reliable one we can
think of.
* It's important that we choose when we intend to query it, before we do so.
* The result of the beacon (and how the beacon is applied to the
parameters, such as what PRNG we use, and the code) needs to be
determined before we query the beacon.
* Since we could choose multiple beacons (and adaptively select from
them) we need to publish our choice of a beacon widely, using
signatures and social media, so that proof we had attempted to do so
would be easy to find.
* Anything else?

So, what beacon should we use? I'm borrowing my recommendation from
advice given by Joseph Bonneau.

I think that we should select a Bitcoin block height (in advance) and
iteratively SHA256 the eventual block (hash or header) n times to
produce the seed of a ChaCha20 PRNG, which is then used to apply the
beacon to the parameters. This iterative function is not intended to
be a proof-of-work function but instead a &quot;delay function,&quot; so it is
deliberately not parallelizable. As the time required for a powerful
adversary to compute the delay function grows (with respect to the
average time between blocks) we become more and more confident the
result could not be significantly influenced.

How large should n be? I think n=2^40 would be enough, since even if
we're off by a couple orders of magnitude the adversary cannot
influence enough bits of the result for it to really matter.

Other questions include: How should we choose the block height? Should
we hash the header or the block hash or even the whole block?
