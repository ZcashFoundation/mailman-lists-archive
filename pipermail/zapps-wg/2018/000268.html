<PRE>Right, of course, I forgot to mention that the sources of entropy should be 
extracted at the same time, so an atacker would need to manipulate one source 
and predict the rest.

Also, I forgot to mention another possible source: the Tor directory 
authorities use a multiparty computation scheme to produce a random value each 
day, to be used by the onion service protocol v3. Maybe it would be worth 
considering it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In order to reduce the probability of a powerful adversary influencing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; beacon, I would propose to use several sources of entropy, mixing them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together (maybe concatenating and hashing) and use the result as a seed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a PRNG. The mentioned bitcoin block could be one of those sources,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but we can also add more. Some ideas:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Results of sports competitions (i.e.: we commit to use the results of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NBA playoffs, or something like that)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Values of several stock markets at a given future date.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Some meteorological information, like &quot;the maximum temperature reached
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these cities in this given future date, as given by the official daily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; report of these organizations.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - Some astronomical phenomena: things like solar activity at a given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; future
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instant (again, as reported by a specific set of observatories that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regularly reports those things), radiation of a specific pulsar...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - number of births/deaths/marriages... in a given set of countries/cities/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whatever (as reported by the corresponding institutions...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, we need to be very specific in advance about how these pieces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information will be collected and represented. But once done that, each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one of them would add extra entropy. That way,  an adversary that wants
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to predict or influence the result of the beacon, would need a huge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; social power to manipulate both sport competitions, stock markets,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scientific institutions, statistical services... And even then, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; meteorological/astronomical reports could only be manipulated to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; limited extent (it would be too evident if the maximum reported
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; temperature differs more than a few degrees to the one that people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually experienced in that place).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The Powers of Tau security proof (see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050">https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050</A>) holds in the &quot;random beacon model,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; meaning that we must apply a random beacon at the end of the ceremony.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's not good enough to use (say) a hash of the transcript, because of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; adaptive attacks (the last participant could predict the beacon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; output). We must apply a beacon that is queried after the ceremony has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; completed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There is some good news on this front:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1. We *can* query reasonably secure beacons. More on that later.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2. Even if the beacon is partially controlled by an adversary, we only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lose a bit of security for every bit of the beacon output that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; influenced by the adversary. This means our beacon could be somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; broken and we'll live in acceptable security bounds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 3. Even if the beacon is _totally_ insecure, it may not even matter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because we may be able to prove the MPC is secure using the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; assumptions the proving system itself uses. We haven't had time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; write a security proof of this yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 4. Even if we choose a _totally_ insecure beacon, you can just apply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; your own beacon instead (one that you're more confident in, or perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the result of a random coinflip protocol depending on what you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; doing).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But, let's choose a pretty good beacon anyway. Some notes on that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * There is a large space of possible choices for a beacon, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; important that we choose the most obvious and reliable one we can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; think of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * It's important that we choose when we intend to query it, before we do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; so. * The result of the beacon (and how the beacon is applied to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; parameters, such as what PRNG we use, and the code) needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; determined before we query the beacon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * Since we could choose multiple beacons (and adaptively select from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; them) we need to publish our choice of a beacon widely, using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; signatures and social media, so that proof we had attempted to do so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; would be easy to find.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * Anything else?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So, what beacon should we use? I'm borrowing my recommendation from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; advice given by Joseph Bonneau.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think that we should select a Bitcoin block height (in advance) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; iteratively SHA256 the eventual block (hash or header) n times to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; produce the seed of a ChaCha20 PRNG, which is then used to apply the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; beacon to the parameters. This iterative function is not intended to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be a proof-of-work function but instead a &quot;delay function,&quot; so it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; deliberately not parallelizable. As the time required for a powerful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; adversary to compute the delay function grows (with respect to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; average time between blocks) we become more and more confident the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; result could not be significantly influenced.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How large should n be? I think n=2^40 would be enough, since even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we're off by a couple orders of magnitude the adversary cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; influence enough bits of the result for it to really matter.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Other questions include: How should we choose the block height? Should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we hash the header or the block hash or even the whole block?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
