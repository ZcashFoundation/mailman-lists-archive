<PRE>Short answer: not until the Sapling-circuit is ready and we need volunteers
for the Second Phase.

It's technically possible for anyone to keep  building on Powers of Tau
(the first phase). The code continues to be available, and you could fork
the attestations repo to keep adding. But Sean has to move on and, like,
make Sapling happen. If anyone else wants to pick up the reins and help
coordinate people, I'd be happy to keep using the Zcash Foundation repos
for it too. Jason would you have any interest in continuing to schedule
people who really want to participate?

Also I think we should start a new Powers of Tau for alt_bn128 so we can
use it on Ethereum. Has anyone implemented the Groth16 snark verifier in
Solidity?
