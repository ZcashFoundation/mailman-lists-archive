<PRE>Hi Peter,

I mentioned in another discussion that I wanted to announce the beacon
in advance and publish it on the mailing list, signed, so that if I
had attempted to adaptively choose amongst different beacons someone
could demonstrate it by posting both signatures. I think this is good
enough; your suggestion is interesting too!

The timestamp is just a harmless demonstration of defense in depth.
Not including it might have suggested I couldn't; since it's cheap and
easy, why not.

Sean
