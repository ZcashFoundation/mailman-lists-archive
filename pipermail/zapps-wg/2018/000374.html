<PRE>Thank you for the note Ian!

  I want to make sure that this thread and mailing list is available for
people to announce  their intent to participate, if they want. A good
reason *not* to announce your intent in this channel, especially ahead of
time, is if you want to keep it a secret for better opsec. But on the other
hand, if you're concerned about being *excluded* by the coordinators (i.e.
Ian or the company in general), then since this channel is independent and
publicly and transparently logged, it's a good backup.

 I would also say that anyone who participated in the Powers of Tau should
also be reached out to offer to participate in this round too! Maybe we can
help if you're not already doing that.
Thanks again!

Hey everyone,

My name is Ian Munoz and I work for the Zcash Company. I'm helping to
coordinate the Sapling MPC.

You can read the blog post here:

<A HREF="https://blog.z.cash/sapling-mpc/">https://blog.z.cash/sapling-mpc/</A>

You can see the current folks whom have participated here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-mpc/wiki">https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/sapling-mpc/wiki</A>

We put together a little bit of automation to help folks to contribute.
Essentially once a participant has uploaded there contribution, the
verification of their contribution is kicked off automatically to help get
more participants in and to prevent any squashing of contributions.

If you would like to participate and you haven't already e-mail: mpc at z
dot cash

You can also reach out on this channel:

Thanks!
