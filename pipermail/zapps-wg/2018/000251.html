Greetings everyone!

My name is Nathaniel Kramer. I am an independent media maker, and I have been a cryptocurrency enthusiast since 2013.

In late 2016, a while after expressing to Zooko my interest in his efforts, I had the opportunity to work as an independent contractor for the Zcash company, making the Denver station media recordings of the first MPC Ceremony. Later, these recordings contributed to the Radiolab program called The Ceremony that aired in July 2017, as well as other media that have since made their way out to the world.

Now, I am interested in making one or more media pieces that feature Zcash and The Ceremony myself. This brings me to my point; I would like to request recordings of people's Powers of Tau Ceremony preparation, computation, communication with the email list, and destruction of the secrets.

These recordings are not intended to be formal evidence of a computation round; but they may turn out to play a critical role in constructing a story that could be shared widely, and might be of interest to a broader audience.

This is at present an independent, non-commercial effort--I am not being paid by the Zcash company, Zcash foundation, or any private donors or companies. If in the future an opportunity arises to partner with someone or an organization that could help increase the quality of the production or help to distribute it more effectively, I would consider cooperation--but in no case will I relinquish my ability to deliver a final product that I approve of.

My goal is to help people understand this technology, open a window to an interesting scene, and communicate about why this technology is important--while also being engaging enough to keep the interest of an intelligent, but general audience.

For now, I think this is sufficient! I don't want to clog the mailing list with too many details at once, but I will follow up with more specifics if there is an interest, or feel free to contact me at natkramercomms[at.]protonmail.com.

Best regards,
- -Nat
