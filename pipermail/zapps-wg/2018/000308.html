<PRE>It sounds like an efficient way to dispense with the suggestions Devrandom
raised are to:
1. Do a round with the deterministic Go build, explicitly saving the binary
for posthoc analysis, and ideally running it on a non x86 architecture if
anyone has one...
2. Do a round with mrustc
What would it take to get a concrete plan to include those?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have some concerns about the lack of diversity of contributions:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - most (all?) of the contributions used a distributed Rust toolchain,
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; suffers from the &quot;trusting-trust&quot; issue since they are self-compiled.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; don't think I've seen any contributions using the mrustc build path.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - there were very few contributions (two?) using the golang
</I>&gt;<i> implementation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - no attempt has been made to replicate the deterministic golang build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - people did not capture the binary they used, so we can't do forensics
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; case of future questions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - there were no contributions using alternative processor architectures
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (e.g. ARM64).  I believe this is possible using the golang
</I>&gt;<i> implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - there was a lot of focus on destroying toxic waste and not enough on
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; trustworthiness of the tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with all these points, particularly the latter: we should be
</I>&gt;<i> focused on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; genuine security, not flashy marketing stunts. (indeed, I regret the way
</I>&gt;<i> my own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participation was marketted the last time around)
