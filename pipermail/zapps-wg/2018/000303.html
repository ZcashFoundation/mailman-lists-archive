<PRE>Hi all,

I have some concerns about the lack of diversity of contributions:

- most (all?) of the contributions used a distributed Rust toolchain, which
suffers from the &quot;trusting-trust&quot; issue since they are self-compiled.  I
don't think I've seen any contributions using the mrustc build path.
- there were very few contributions (two?) using the golang implementation
- no attempt has been made to replicate the deterministic golang build
- people did not capture the binary they used, so we can't do forensics in
case of future questions
- there were no contributions using alternative processor architectures
(e.g. ARM64).  I believe this is possible using the golang implementation.
- there was a lot of focus on destroying toxic waste and not enough on the
trustworthiness of the tools

Lastly, the deadline was announce less than a week in advance, which makes
it difficult to address the above issues.

</I>&gt;<i> start using the powers-of-tau from early phases if you want too.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. While we'll go along with Sean's suggestion to conclude the &quot;official&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> one on Mar 15, which will be used for Sapling, if there's interest from the
</I>&gt;<i> community in continuing to add more rounds, the Foundation will continue to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate that, probably in another branch to avoid any confusion.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. So far we have only been doing powers of tau for the 2^21 size circuit,
</I>&gt;<i> over the BLS12-381 curve. If there is any interest in conducting Powers of
</I>&gt;<i> Tau for larger circuit sizes, or for different curves (such as the
</I>&gt;<i> alt_bn128 supported in Ethereum), then the Foundation would support that
</I>&gt;<i> too. Although someone would have to adapt Sean's or FiloSottile's code to
</I>&gt;<i> do so...
