<PRE>These are good suggestions, but I don't think any of the relevant
attack vectors could feasibly hide from analysis. Perhaps a ceremony
based on Powers of Tau can address them for additional confidence.

I don't think anyone posted their compute binaries but many did post
hashes of them, which is sufficient to reproduce them and ensure
consistency between the toolchains and resulting binary behavior. I
feel like an attack that survives this kind of scrutiny would be
unbelievable.

Here's an example: I didn't use the mrustc build path, but my
participation benefits from it concretely. My participation used a
cut-and-choose protocol to make it difficult for the machine to guess
which (deterministic!) response file I intended to select before it
committed to all of the accepted outputs. If there were some kind of
compiler backdoor I could compile the code with the mrustc build path
and check that it produces the same output, mitigating _any_ kind of
backdoor in the Rust compiler distributions.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some concerns about the lack of diversity of contributions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - most (all?) of the contributions used a distributed Rust toolchain, which
</I>&gt;<i> suffers from the &quot;trusting-trust&quot; issue since they are self-compiled.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think I've seen any contributions using the mrustc build path.
</I>&gt;<i> - there were very few contributions (two?) using the golang implementation
</I>&gt;<i> - no attempt has been made to replicate the deterministic golang build
</I>&gt;<i> - people did not capture the binary they used, so we can't do forensics in
</I>&gt;<i> case of future questions
</I>&gt;<i> - there were no contributions using alternative processor architectures
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. ARM64).  I believe this is possible using the golang implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> - there was a lot of focus on destroying toxic waste and not enough on the
</I>&gt;<i> trustworthiness of the tools
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, the deadline was announce less than a week in advance, which makes
</I>&gt;<i> it difficult to address the above issues.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me add a bit to this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. First of all, all the code you need to add your own rounds to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> powers-of-tau is already provided in Sean's repo. You could fork the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository and add more rounds yourself if you wanted to. You could also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start using the powers-of-tau from early phases if you want too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. While we'll go along with Sean's suggestion to conclude the &quot;official&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one on Mar 15, which will be used for Sapling, if there's interest from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community in continuing to add more rounds, the Foundation will continue to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> facilitate that, probably in another branch to avoid any confusion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. So far we have only been doing powers of tau for the 2^21 size circuit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> over the BLS12-381 curve. If there is any interest in conducting Powers of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tau for larger circuit sizes, or for different curves (such as the alt_bn128
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supported in Ethereum), then the Foundation would support that too. Although
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone would have to adapt Sean's or FiloSottile's code to do so...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
