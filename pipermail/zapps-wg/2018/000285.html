<PRE>Hello!

I was going to use an 18 year old desktop. However I had issue after 
issue with hardware and software on it so I decided to switch to another 
computer. The computer I used is an 11 year old laptop from 2007. I ran 
Rust 1.24.0 on Linux Mint 18.3 Mate Edition 32-bit. This was a fresh 
install.

Wifi was disabled and not setup. I temporarily connected to the internet 
via ethernet. I installed patches etc. After installing Rust and 
compiling Powers of Tau I disconnected the laptop from the internet by 
unplugging the ethernet cable.

I made sure my house was secure by checking for intruders all through 
out the house. I also made sure the house was locked properly.

During my part of the ceremony I made sure that no one entered my room 
where the laptop was. I transferred the challenge file onto the laptop 
with a brand new 32GB flash drive.

For the random input I rolled some dice(3d10, 3 results from 10 sided 
dice) to get random numbers. These were put in directly or used to pick 
a page in a book. I picked the first word I saw on the random pages. I 
also typed random letters.

The laptop will be turned off for a day to clear out the RAM. I am 
planning to wipe the hard drive afterwards. I&#8217;ll sent out a tweet 
confirming that the hard drive has been wiped.

My BLAKE2b hash is
0534d0bb 2a88706e d0416219 b9ed9303
b447f444 4a2576c5 eb3cc9f7 ae001a8c

5bd5446a 64807462 5b121986 d936db02

The hash is also listed on twitter and gab.ai
