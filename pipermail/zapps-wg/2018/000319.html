<PRE>Hi

We finally did it. Thanks to Sean, Jason and the Zcash Foundation for 
make it possible.

Here our signed report.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Powers of Tau Operational Writeup
=================================

Round: 70
Date: 2018-03-06
Name: Zcash FR Team
Location: Paris, FR


Preparation steps
=================

Zcash FR Team is currently compose of 3 members. Each member brings is 
own computer prepared by himself. We did not talk to each other which 
preparation was made neither which software or version was installed.

Sidechannel Defences
====================

The computing process was done in the flat of a Zcash FR Team member. In 
this flat there was the 3 members of Zcash FR Team and nobody else.
Computing was done offline.

Procedure
=========

We start with 3 computers ready to compute. For convenience reason we 
needed to use 1 computer so we took 1 computer at random and get it off 
the computing process.

Then we downloaded the challenge file on the 2 computers selected to 
participate.

The text entered to provide additional entropy was different on the 2 
computers.
It was composed of :
- - - Random type
- - - Name of Zcash FR Team members
- - - Information display on TV channel
- - - Play card picked randomly


After the response file was generated on both computer we decided to 
play a video game to decide which response file will be send. The winner 
send is own response file.


The BLAKE2b hash of `./response` is:
         9298f7b3 31daa220 55c31fae 4564ca59
         33e0a1ce 6861c92d 33d755bc 4a68756d
         6b1c6f78 7a2c4a1a 53681f2b b4026ece
         350bb618 d8a9f847 2b18ddc2 ce117865



Postprocessing
==============
Nothing special, the computer was turn off.
