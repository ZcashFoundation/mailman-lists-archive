Procedure
=========

2017-11-18
- ----------

I withdrew cash from an ATM I happened to be passing in London.

2017-11-19
- ----------

I withdrew more cash from a different ATM. I then drove four hours south-west of
London to my grandmother's farm. She lives in a valley with no cell reception,
and her granite house is well-known in our family for its electromagnetic and
audio shielding properties (ie. WiFi reception sucks beyond the one room the
router is in, and you can't hear someone calling you from a few rooms away).

On the way down, I stopped in at a shopping center, turning off my phone and
leaving it in the car. I then purchased:

- - An HP Pavilion Notebook 15 (15-cd054na)
  - I had no device in mind when I entered the store. After browsing the
    available models, I chose this laptop based on a combination of price,
    performance, the use of an AMD chip, and the presence of a DVD burner.
  - I asked the sales assistant if I could choose a laptop at random from their
    stock room. The manager confirmed I could not, as it was a secure area. I
    asked them to bring out three laptops for me to choose from, which they did.
    I flipped two coins to determine which of the three I chose.
- - Five identical USB drives
- - A stack of 10 DVD+R discs (which were eventually not used)
- - A screwdriver set
- - A soldering iron (which turned out to be unnecessary)

2017-11-20
- ----------

I unboxed the laptop, and opened it up. I removed the WiFi/Bluetooth chip, and
unplugged the built-in speakers. I then started the laptop and set up the
default Windows installation, confirming that there was no wireless connectivity
or sound, but the headphone jack still worked. I pried off the screen bezel,
unplugged the built-in camera and microphone array, and confirmed that they both
no longer worked (the microphone array still showed up as a device, but
registered no input).

I used Tor Browser and the Tails downloader plugin to download the Tails 3.3 ISO
(the first deterministically-built one) on my development laptop (a Thinkpad X1
Carbon Gen4), and verified its GPG signature. SHA256 hash of the ISO:

    5ac6b8a563a999701aa394a0761ba3e29d5a964537549e5b4a81b2abf12a1c09

I also installed tails-live-installer from their PPA.

2017-11-22
- ----------

I opened up the laptop again, and confirmed that the wireless functionality and
speakers were still disabled. I then removed the hard drive and re-assembled the
laptop. From this point onward, I did not let the laptop (henceforth referred to
as the compute node), nor any of the USB drives, out of my sight for more than a
few seconds.

I rolled a dice to select one of the five USB drives at random. I used
tails-live-installer to install Tails 3.3 on the USB drive. I then realised that
I hadn't yet upgraded the drivers for my development laptop to fix the Intel
AMT/ME vulnerability. I booted into the Windows partition to do so. Following
this, I rebooted into Ubuntu again, imaged the USB drive, and then wiped it and
re-installed Tails 3.3.

I installed Docker CE on my development laptop, and used Andrew Miller's
Dockerfile to deterministically build the powersoftau compute binary. SHA256
hash:

    922b2e0a59841ecdaba7b4953d8c67e62b74b8f52f968624cff664dc086da93a

On my Qubes 3.2 laptop (a Purism Librem 15) I created a disposable VM, and
downloaded the challenge file in it. SHA256 hash:

    d27e5d6c5a7611f6690443d8a47c6ebd134bc863f05984d9b3d845060a3f036a

I created a fresh AppVM for staging (backed by the fully-upgraded
fedora-24-minimal TemplateVM) with network access. I ran the following commands:

$ su - (the minimal template does not have sudo)
$ dnf config-manager \
    --add-repo \
    <A HREF="https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo">https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo</A>
$ dnf install docker-ce
$ docker --version
Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
$ systemctl start docker
$ docker run -it socrates1024/powersoftau
[snip]
Digest: sha256:3d42ec3bc947c410dca07e4bbbe5e88bf264b147ecaa87807ec58424f309b046
$ $ sha256sum target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/compute

    922b2e0a59841ecdaba7b4953d8c67e62b74b8f52f968624cff664dc086da93a

Having obtained the same binary hash on both machines, I then fetched the
compute binary out of the staging AppVM's Docker container, and copied the
challenge file from the disposable AppVM to the staging AppVM. I also downloaded
EFF's long wordlist: <A HREF="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt">https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt</A>
SHA256 hash:

    addd35536511597a02fa0a9ff1e5284677b8883b83e986e43f15a3db996b903e

BEGIN COMPUTATION STEPS
```````````````````````
I rolled a dice to select one of the four remaining USB drives at random. I
attached the USB drive to my Qubes laptop, and then redirected it from sys-usb
to the staging AppVM using qubes-usb on Dom0. I copied the challenge file, the
compute binary, and the wordlist to the USB drive.

I took the compute node, Tails USB drive, and challenge USB drive to a room at
the far end of the house (from the router), which had the most line-of-sight
granite surrounding it, and also had a large metal filing cabinet. I emptied one
of the drawers and set up the compute node inside it. I inserted the Tails USB
drive, started the compute node, and disabled SecureBoot. Once in the Tails
environment, I inserted the challenge USB drive, copied the compute binary and
wordlist to the Tails home directory (in RAM), and symlinked the challenge file
into that directory (as I didn't have enough RAM to hold the challenge file in
memory twice).

I started the compute binary, opened the wordlist, and then used five dice (of
assorted sizes, that I scrounged from around the house) in a cardboard box to
generate an eight-word random phrase. I typed the phrase into the compute binary
input (space-separated, no leading or trailing spaces), and also wrote it down
on the inside of a piece of folded card. I then started the computation process,
and closed the filing cabinet drawer. The computation took around 40 minutes,
during which I sat beside it, occasionally pulling the drawer open slightly to
check progress, and reading Serious Cryptography in between. At the point where
I noticed that the challenge itself had been read into memory, I unmounted and
removed the challenge USB drive.

After the computation was completed, I rolled a dice to select one of the three
remaining USB drives at random. I copied the response file to it, and used my
phone to tweet out the BLAKE2b hash printed by the compute binary:

    2c052c1f 039810e7 69779017 9943bdb9
    d00a84fb 25593453 85af3826 1fbe061c
    4dc79f4e 87da26f4 3202bcf4 3960db16
    be870511 7f3de50c 8922b502 32a3e126

I then shut down the compute node.

END COMPUTATION STEPS
`````````````````````

I repeated the steps above a second time (using the two remaining USB drives),
to obtain a second response file, and a second BLAKE2b hash:

    3df44b57 4c66cb75 9bba2f2a 96b12ea1
    9037a70c 4c898397 35ad6b3d 50b84715
    39bfdea2 0d6e6db3 79ce6f3d 3d823d32
    901d2651 20481863 45d99475 e63a91a9

Finally, I rolled a dice to decide which of the two responses to upload; the
dice landed on an odd number, meaning that I uploaded the first response. I am
revealing the randomness used to compute the second response:

    boogeyman amber reverse oversight scorn impending wheat engraver

After typing in the above phrase, I burned the card on which I had written the
two random phrases. I opened up the compute node, and removed the battery and
RAM stick. I have not yet destroyed the RAM chips, and am keeping the stick on
my person until I am able to (so I've probably damaged it already with static).

I connected the USB drive containing the first response to my Qubes laptop, and
then redirected it from sys-usb to the staging AppVM. I then copied the response
to the disposable AppVM, and then into another AppVM to upload it to one of my
personal servers (as the upload to AWS was timing out).


Security Considerations
=======================

- - The laptop was chosen randomly, with as little unreported bias as possible,
  and with my participation at that point only mentioned to Sean. However, a
  sufficiently-motivated adversary could potentially have figured out that I was
  participating, guessed which store I would go to on my route, and persuaded
  the staff to alter the displays to draw my attention towards a particular
  laptop. A constraint, or a private deterministic metric for selection, may
  have helped to eliminate more bias.

- - Using a deterministically-built ISO for the operating system should make it
  easier to determine the OS code that was running at the time, modulo the trust
  in the machine that the live USB was built on (which is my Zcash dev laptop).

- - Using a fresh Qubes AppVM for staging increases the bar for having
compromised
  the OS in order to compromise the challenge USB drive.

- - Tails by default disables sudo and mounts itself as read-only,
meaning that a
  malicious userspace process shouldn't be able to persist data on that USB
  drive.

- - Tails by default mounts plugged-in USB drives as read-write. Using
a fresh USB
  drive each time to transfer the compute binary, challenge and wordlist to the
  compute node removed that as a vector for persistance between iterations.

- - Revealing the randomness in the unused response, after the compute node had
  been shut down, should make it possible to ascertain that the compute binary
  was behaving correctly, by having third parties independently re-compute the
  corresponding response file and verify the hash against the one I published.


Things I'd Do Differently In Future
===================================

- - Pick somewhere with faster internet. The internet here isn't snappy to begin
  with, and it was raining and blowing which significantly impacts speeds. As a
  result, the challenge file took several hours to download, and the response
  file took probably double that.

- - Use a DVD to set up the compute OS instead of a USB (and then load
the OS into
  RAM to free up the DVD drive). A DVD would in theory be more easily auditable,
  putting less trust in the machine creating it than the live USB. This would
  also increase the amount of RAM required in the machine (I ran this entirely
  in 4GB memory).

- - Build the compute binary ahead of time. In particular, the time it took to
  download Docker and build dependencies (twice) significantly extended the
  setup time.

- - The binary was built deterministically, but it would be preferable
to have it
  only use dependencies and a compiler that could be reasonably assumed to not
  have backdoors targeted at the MPC in general or participants in particular. I
  did briefly try to compile Devrandom's branch, but decided determinism was
  more important for now.

- - Monitor and keyboard. I had to open the filing cabinet drawer in
order to type
  in the randomness and monitor progress; an external monitor and keyboard would
  limit the EM leakage of doing so.

- - Hardware separation of randomness. There was maybe 10 minutes between
  compute iterations (as I created the second challenge USB drive), and the
  battery was not removed in between (as that required disassembly), so there is
  a small but non-zero possibility that the second computation could have been
  influenced by (maliciously or otherwise) the first one. In this case it
  happens to not matter much, as the random roll at the end selected the result
  of the first computation, but in a future MPC I'd prefer to at least remove
  the battery in between runs, and ideally swap out the RAM.

- - Different response extraction mechanism. I neglected to purchase a
DVD reader
  for my existing laptops, so could not use DVDs as the airgap mechanism,
  falling back to the USB drives. I also had a more ambitious mechanism in mind,
  but that will require significant additional development work.

- - Use a separate AppVM for staging the response. I had intended to do this (to
  limit the ability of any malicious data hidden on the response USB to escape),
  but reused the previous qubes-usb command neglecting to change the AppVM name.
  Once it was connected to the challenge staging VM, I decided that any damage
  had already been done, and continued.
