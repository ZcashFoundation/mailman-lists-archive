<PRE>Note that the `response` file contains a hash of the `challenge` file
that was used as input for the compute tool. As a result, only the
hashes of the `response` files need to be published; a hash chain is
formed through all participants. The initial challenge file is
deterministic. (You can use the `new` tool on the repository to
construct it.)

The initial challenge file has BLAKE2b hash:

ce00f2100dd876fdff8dd824f55307bcb72d724f29ff20b9e0760f3a65e5588a65eaed57cbc61697111ae1f4cc7da2e62a85311c2ae683a041fb872b891c68dc

It doesn't hurt to post hashes of everything though. Hash all the things.

&gt;<i> Thanks Sean!

</I>&gt;<i> My idea is to use an ad hoc and publicly visible process. &quot;Get in
</I>&gt;<i> contact with [sean]&quot; could be as simple as posting in public to this
</I>&gt;<i> thread. Unless we're overrun by trolls, a public mailing list can be
</I>&gt;<i> an informal way to agree on who goes next. Whoever posts and says &quot;Me,
</I>&gt;<i> me! I'd like to go next&quot;, should, by convention, go next. Any
</I>&gt;<i> aberrations (parties taking too long or dropping out, posting invalid
</I>&gt;<i> data, etc., can be dealt with as needed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe it's also the case that
</I>&gt;<i> a) The &quot;response&quot; file from each person is roughly the same as the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;challenge&quot; file for the next participant, and
</I>&gt;<i> b) The response/challenge files are safe to be published at any time,
</I>&gt;<i> not private at all.
</I>&gt;<i> So, by convention, we should post the hashes of those files here right
</I>&gt;<i> away, and make a best effort to mirror them publicly (each one is like
</I>&gt;<i> a gigabyte, I think).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does the initial challenge file consist of? Could you post the
</I>&gt;<i> hash of it here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ariel Gabizon, Ian Miers and I have just published a new paper detailing a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The highlights are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * It allows for a single, gigantic ceremony to take place for all possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zk-SNARK circuits within a given size bound. The results of this ceremony
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are partial zk-SNARK parameters for the entire community. We call this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communal ceremony the Powers of Tau.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * If you want to use zk-SNARKs in your protocols, you still have to do an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MPC for your circuit. But because of the Powers of Tau ceremony, your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ceremony is much cheaper to perform and the costs per-participant scale
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linearly with respect to the circuit complexity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The best part is that the Powers of Tau and these circuit-specific MPCs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can scale to hundreds/thousands of participants. As the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants grows, it becomes unrealistic that all of them could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compromised.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, let's do the Powers of Tau ceremony! The Zcash Foundation is excited to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate in the process. The Zcash Company is particularly excited in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> starting soon because we want to leverage it for our next MPC for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sapling upgrade of Zcash.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MPC protocol for this ceremony only requires that one participant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> successfully destroy the secret randomness they sample during their part. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intend to give participants total flexibility in deciding how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate; we don't mind what software, hardware or OS you use.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have written some Rust software for participants to run:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/ebfull/powersoftau">https://github.com/ebfull/powersoftau</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to simplify auditing, I won't be making any more changes to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> code unless absolutely necessary. You don't have to use this software, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are no alternative implementations at this time. I think it should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feasible to write a C version of the code using the RELIC toolkit, which has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented BLS12-381. I am very confident in the Rust code, though, and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe in its stability/correctness.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have some opinions about the ceremony:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. I disagree with processes that don't improve security of the ceremony.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having a small surface area of code and process increases the chance that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bugs will be discovered by auditors because there are fewer things that can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go wrong. Remember that there is already quite a bit for the public to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check: the transcript correctness, the code correctness, the randomness
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beacon, the cryptographic proof, code dependencies, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. It needs to start soon so that it can be useful for the Sapling MPC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. It needs to have lots of reputable participants by the time we start the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sapling MPC.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given the above, I would like to suggest that we start the ceremony now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using my existing code, which supports circuits up to 2^21 gates. This means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people would just get in contact with me if they want to participate and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll schedule them in. I'll try to prioritize reputable people, but I'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow pretty much anyone I have time to. Everything that I do is publicly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verifiable (there is a transcript at the end of the ceremony which people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can check).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Andrew Miller has a few interesting ideas for a more distributed process for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scheduling &quot;who goes next&quot; but there are some disadvantages and risks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved IMO. In any case, the process can be changed later without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affecting anything, so I don't see a purpose in delaying the start of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ceremony on such things.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd like to hear from others about this plan so we can begin soon!
