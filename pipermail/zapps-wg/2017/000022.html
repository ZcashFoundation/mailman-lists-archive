<PRE>&gt;<i> Q: What exactly happens if one participant fails to destroy that secret and/or
</I>&gt;<i> inputs a low-entropy secret? What about N participants?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The paper states that &quot;We show that security holds even if an adversary has
</I>&gt;<i> limited influence on the beacon.&quot; but it's unclear what exactly &quot;limited
</I>&gt;<i> influence&quot; means.
</I>
My understanding was that we lose N bits of security when an attacker
can influence N bits of the randomness beacon.

This MPC is of the &quot;only one has to be honest&quot; kind. It is irrelevant
if N-1 of the participants have low entropy / known secrets, so long
as just one has high entropy w.r.t. the security parameter.

&gt;<i> As N increases you open up a new exfiltration route: the unused N-1 responses
</I>&gt;<i> could themselves be the exfiltration route, and thus need to be
</I>&gt;<i> deterministically verified against the N-1 unused secrets. This isn't
</I>&gt;<i> particularly user-friendly, and it's easy to imagine how this could be skipped.
</I>
Note that the compute process prints out a hash of the response file,
and so we can &quot;cut-and-choose&quot; in the same way to guard against these
exfiltration routes. As an example, if we use DVDs, we can burn N
response files and note each's respective hash and entropy. Then,
reveal N-1's hash/entropy, but destroy those N-1 DVDs.

&gt;<i> Finally, it's interesting how there's a whole class of &quot;sham&quot; participant
</I>&gt;<i>strategies, where someone who runs the computation and uploads an audit
</I>&gt;<i>response w/ revealed secret, but does not actually participate in that round,
</I>&gt;<i>still frustrates attackers who can not tell in advance if that particular
</I>&gt;<i>participant will or will not actually participate. This suggests that the
</I>&gt;<i>current round's challenge should be made public.
</I>
That's very interesting. Right now the transcript is public and so the
current challenge can be computed by anyone, but it would be a little
better if I put the &quot;current&quot; challenge file up for download.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. the participant's code, compiler, operating system or hardware are backdoored
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our solution to #1 is to have large numbers of diverse participants,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to virtually eliminate the chance that all of them are dishonest and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secretly colluding with each other. I am very confident in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ditto
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many of us are solving #2 by performing the computations on hardware
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we have randomly plucked from a store somewhere, in an environment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (like a Faraday cage, or out in a field somewhere) where side-channel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacks are unlikely. And of course, completely destroying the machine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afterward. I am very confident in this approach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree that this is easily achieved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While ~all the hardware we have available to us is likely backdoored, the bad
</I>&gt;<i> guys can't backdoor the laws of physics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, we don't really have a good handle on #3. Right now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants are using the `powersoftau` code that I've written in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rust. It is possible to change the code or even make an alternative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation, but that only gets you so far. You still have to hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your OS/compiler/hardware are not backdoored.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So to be clear, a simple example of such a backdoor attack would be to take the
</I>&gt;<i> secret k that was supposed to be used in the computation and replace it with
</I>&gt;<i> truncate(k,n), where n is low enough to brute force, and high enough to not get
</I>&gt;<i> caught by the birthday paradox; something like 24-bits is probably feasible.
</I>&gt;<i> The attacker would then brute-force the truncated k from the transcripts,
</I>&gt;<i> recovering the toxic waste.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think there's a nice solution to this problem which is inspired by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an idea that Brian Warner had.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Currently, the code I've written takes some randomness from the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and mixes it with some user-supplied randomness. Instead, imagine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> using randomness supplied by the participant exclusively. (One way the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participant can obtain it is with a boggle set.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that this is better described as a user-supplied *secret*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Q: What exactly happens if one participant fails to destroy that secret and/or
</I>&gt;<i> inputs a low-entropy secret? What about N participants?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The paper states that &quot;We show that security holds even if an adversary has
</I>&gt;<i> limited influence on the beacon.&quot; but it's unclear what exactly &quot;limited
</I>&gt;<i> influence&quot; means.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The trick is that the participant performs the computation N times,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each time with different randomness. This produces N response files.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, the participant randomly chooses N-1 of the response files and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reveals the randomness for them, and destroys the randomness of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> last response file -- which is their contribution to the ceremony. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participant (and the general public) can perform the computations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> again on their machines to check that the same response files are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> produced for the ones we've revealed randomness for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be exact, what you mean to say here is that by re-doing the computations on
</I>&gt;<i> a trusted setup implementation that is *not* backdoored, you can detect the
</I>&gt;<i> existence of the backdoor because the results won't match.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As N increases, the probability that any backdoor in the code,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiler, hardware, operating system etc. could have tampered with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entropy approaches zero. Now there is just one remaining problem: how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do we get the response files out of the machine without the backdoor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially sneaking the entropy over the channel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As N increases you open up a new exfiltration route: the unused N-1 responses
</I>&gt;<i> could themselves be the exfiltration route, and thus need to be
</I>&gt;<i> deterministically verified against the N-1 unused secrets. This isn't
</I>&gt;<i> particularly user-friendly, and it's easy to imagine how this could be skipped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd suggest instead that we ask participants to simply run the computation N&gt;1
</I>&gt;<i> times, and pick at random which output to actually use. If they re-use hardware
</I>&gt;<i> for each run, ask them to do their best at wiping all non-volatile memory; if
</I>&gt;<i> they have the ability to use different hardware for each run, even better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that a variety of procedures to pick outputs at random are desirable. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, one person might decide to flip a coin after each run, and stop when
</I>&gt;<i> it comes up tails; another might do something different. Diversity is good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After they've completed their runs, simply upload one or more dummy runs and
</I>&gt;<i> associated initial secrets for peer auditing, as well as their official
</I>&gt;<i> contribution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, once we do get some dummy runs, I'd suggest that future participants
</I>&gt;<i> consider testing their compute nodes against those challenges and secrets to
</I>&gt;<i> verify that they also get the same results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, it's interesting how there's a whole class of &quot;sham&quot; participant
</I>&gt;<i> strategies, where someone who runs the computation and uploads an audit
</I>&gt;<i> response w/ revealed secret, but does not actually participate in that round,
</I>&gt;<i> still frustrates attackers who can not tell in advance if that particular
</I>&gt;<i> participant will or will not actually participate. This suggests that the
</I>&gt;<i> current round's challenge should be made public.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DVDs are a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach if it's possible to create many of them and then analyze them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for any differences or hidden information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The experience of the previous trusted setup is that no-one bothers to audit
</I>&gt;<i> evidence collected after the fact. For example, I appear to have been the
</I>&gt;<i> *only* non-Zcash team member who ever bothered to even do the basic step of
</I>&gt;<i> recreating the deterministic builds, readily apparent by the fact that they
</I>&gt;<i> were broken about a month after the setup due to two different (still unfixed)
</I>&gt;<i> bugs in the deterministic build scripts(1). So I'd be cautious about putting
</I>&gt;<i> too much emphasis on &quot;paranoid measures&quot; like this when there are more
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental attack vectors to solve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case for this to be effective you really need to completely fill the
</I>&gt;<i> storage medium with a known pattern. You also need to bypass standard
</I>&gt;<i> filesystems, which contain massive amounts of metadata in the form of file
</I>&gt;<i> timestamps and the like - better to write a single file to the medium, and fill
</I>&gt;<i> the rest with zeros.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I noted after the prior trusted setup, CD's/DVD's/etc. are *not* read-only
</I>&gt;<i> once written, as the writable medium can continue to be written to after the
</I>&gt;<i> initial data has been written to it. This means that an attacker could create a
</I>&gt;<i> DVD that, e.g., compromises the drive at a firmware level, exfiltrates the
</I>&gt;<i> secret, and then uses the laser in the DVD reader to erase the evidence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as this setup is multi-participant, this can easily be defeated by using a
</I>&gt;<i> wide variety of techniques. For instance, it turns out that USB drives with
</I>&gt;<i> (allegedly) hardware write-protect switches are readily available, such as the
</I>&gt;<i> Kanguru FlashBlu series:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://store.kanguru.com/pages/flash-blu-2">https://store.kanguru.com/pages/flash-blu-2</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, using a semi-trusted &quot;firewall&quot; machine that reads the medium, and
</I>&gt;<i> then copies it to a new medium can also avoid unintended data leaks between
</I>&gt;<i> those two mediums.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) <A HREF="https://github.com/zcash/mpc/pull/9">https://github.com/zcash/mpc/pull/9</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (The original idea that Brian and Zooko briefly considered for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Zcash ceremony last year was similar, except it involved one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants revealing all their entropy at the end, and the rest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destroying theirs. This is because the previous protocol couldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support participants performing multiple computations, because they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had to commit to their entropy at the very beginning. The new protocol
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does support participants performing multiple computations with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different entropy, though!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looks like both myself and Saleem Rashid had similar ideas as well, so either
</I>&gt;<i> it's a good one or we're all wrong. :)
