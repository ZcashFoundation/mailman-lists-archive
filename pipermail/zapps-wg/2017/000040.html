Indeed. The ceremony itself cannot be a source of randomness or it
would be vulnerable to adaptive attacks.

This deserves its own thread, but there are much better beacons than
NIST's available to us. Joseph Bonneau suggested an iterated hash over
(say) a future bitcoin block, serving as a kind of delay function.

</I>&gt;<i> Right
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; As N increases you open up a new exfiltration route: the unused N-1 responses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could themselves be the exfiltration route, and thus need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; deterministically verified against the N-1 unused secrets. This isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; particularly user-friendly, and it's easy to imagine how this could be skipped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that the compute process prints out a hash of the response file,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so we can &quot;cut-and-choose&quot; in the same way to guard against these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exfiltration routes. As an example, if we use DVDs, we can burn N
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response files and note each's respective hash and entropy. Then,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reveal N-1's hash/entropy, but destroy those N-1 DVDs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But note here how there's more opportunities to leak data because the
</I>&gt;<i> secrets(1) associated with each DVD are simultaneously available to the
</I>&gt;<i> attacker. OTOH, by simply doing each round separately the code is both simpler,
</I>&gt;<i> and the attacker has access to less information as only one secret should be
</I>&gt;<i> available to them at a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Entropy is an *implementation* of a secret; entropy itself isn't enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, it's interesting how there's a whole class of &quot;sham&quot; participant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;strategies, where someone who runs the computation and uploads an audit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;response w/ revealed secret, but does not actually participate in that round,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;still frustrates attackers who can not tell in advance if that particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;participant will or will not actually participate. This suggests that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;current round's challenge should be made public.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's very interesting. Right now the transcript is public and so the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current challenge can be computed by anyone, but it would be a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better if I put the &quot;current&quot; challenge file up for download.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Publishing a link on this mailing list would work well. Secondly, as we'll have
</I>&gt;<i> to archive all this stuff anyway, I'd suggest using the Internet Archive for
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of the challenges.
