<PRE>Thanks! I'm verifying your contribution.

Note that the `powersoftau` code, unmodified, does not act
determinisically with the random input provided by the user, so:

&gt;<i> - - Revealing the randomness in the unused response, after the compute node had
</I>&gt;<i>   been shut down, should make it possible to ascertain that the compute binary
</I>&gt;<i>   was behaving correctly, by having third parties independently re-compute the
</I>&gt;<i>   corresponding response file and verify the hash against the one I published.
</I>
is not true unless you modified the code so that it does not try to
mix in system randomness as well.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Procedure
</I>&gt;<i> =========
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2017-11-18
</I>&gt;<i> - ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I withdrew cash from an ATM I happened to be passing in London.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2017-11-19
</I>&gt;<i> - ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I withdrew more cash from a different ATM. I then drove four hours
</I>&gt;<i> south-west of
</I>&gt;<i> London to my grandmother's farm. She lives in a valley with no cell
</I>&gt;<i> reception,
</I>&gt;<i> and her granite house is well-known in our family for its electromagnetic
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> audio shielding properties (ie. WiFi reception sucks beyond the one room the
</I>&gt;<i> router is in, and you can't hear someone calling you from a few rooms away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the way down, I stopped in at a shopping center, turning off my phone and
</I>&gt;<i> leaving it in the car. I then purchased:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - An HP Pavilion Notebook 15 (15-cd054na)
</I>&gt;<i>   - I had no device in mind when I entered the store. After browsing the
</I>&gt;<i>     available models, I chose this laptop based on a combination of price,
</I>&gt;<i>     performance, the use of an AMD chip, and the presence of a DVD burner.
</I>&gt;<i>   - I asked the sales assistant if I could choose a laptop at random from
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i>     stock room. The manager confirmed I could not, as it was a secure area.
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i>     asked them to bring out three laptops for me to choose from, which they
</I>&gt;<i> did.
</I>&gt;<i>     I flipped two coins to determine which of the three I chose.
</I>&gt;<i> - - Five identical USB drives
</I>&gt;<i> - - A stack of 10 DVD+R discs (which were eventually not used)
</I>&gt;<i> - - A screwdriver set
</I>&gt;<i> - - A soldering iron (which turned out to be unnecessary)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2017-11-20
</I>&gt;<i> - ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I unboxed the laptop, and opened it up. I removed the WiFi/Bluetooth chip,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> unplugged the built-in speakers. I then started the laptop and set up the
</I>&gt;<i> default Windows installation, confirming that there was no wireless
</I>&gt;<i> connectivity
</I>&gt;<i> or sound, but the headphone jack still worked. I pried off the screen bezel,
</I>&gt;<i> unplugged the built-in camera and microphone array, and confirmed that they
</I>&gt;<i> both
</I>&gt;<i> no longer worked (the microphone array still showed up as a device, but
</I>&gt;<i> registered no input).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used Tor Browser and the Tails downloader plugin to download the Tails 3.3
</I>&gt;<i> ISO
</I>&gt;<i> (the first deterministically-built one) on my development laptop (a Thinkpad
</I>&gt;<i> X1
</I>&gt;<i> Carbon Gen4), and verified its GPG signature. SHA256 hash of the ISO:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     5ac6b8a563a999701aa394a0761ba3e29d5a964537549e5b4a81b2abf12a1c09
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also installed tails-live-installer from their PPA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2017-11-22
</I>&gt;<i> - ----------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I opened up the laptop again, and confirmed that the wireless functionality
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> speakers were still disabled. I then removed the hard drive and re-assembled
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> laptop. From this point onward, I did not let the laptop (henceforth
</I>&gt;<i> referred to
</I>&gt;<i> as the compute node), nor any of the USB drives, out of my sight for more
</I>&gt;<i> than a
</I>&gt;<i> few seconds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I rolled a dice to select one of the five USB drives at random. I used
</I>&gt;<i> tails-live-installer to install Tails 3.3 on the USB drive. I then realised
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't yet upgraded the drivers for my development laptop to fix the Intel
</I>&gt;<i> AMT/ME vulnerability. I booted into the Windows partition to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> Following
</I>&gt;<i> this, I rebooted into Ubuntu again, imaged the USB drive, and then wiped it
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> re-installed Tails 3.3.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I installed Docker CE on my development laptop, and used Andrew Miller's
</I>&gt;<i> Dockerfile to deterministically build the powersoftau compute binary. SHA256
</I>&gt;<i> hash:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     922b2e0a59841ecdaba7b4953d8c67e62b74b8f52f968624cff664dc086da93a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On my Qubes 3.2 laptop (a Purism Librem 15) I created a disposable VM, and
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded the challenge file in it. SHA256 hash:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     d27e5d6c5a7611f6690443d8a47c6ebd134bc863f05984d9b3d845060a3f036a
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I created a fresh AppVM for staging (backed by the fully-upgraded
</I>&gt;<i> fedora-24-minimal TemplateVM) with network access. I ran the following
</I>&gt;<i> commands:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $ su - (the minimal template does not have sudo)
</I>&gt;<i> $ dnf config-manager \
</I>&gt;<i>     --add-repo \
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo">https://download.docker.com/linux/fedora/docker-ce.repo</A>
</I>&gt;<i> $ dnf install docker-ce
</I>&gt;<i> $ docker --version
</I>&gt;<i> Docker version 17.06.0-ce, build 02c1d87
</I>&gt;<i> $ systemctl start docker
</I>&gt;<i> $ docker run -it socrates1024/powersoftau
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> Digest:
</I>&gt;<i> sha256:3d42ec3bc947c410dca07e4bbbe5e88bf264b147ecaa87807ec58424f309b046

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having obtained the same binary hash on both machines, I then fetched the
</I>&gt;<i> compute binary out of the staging AppVM's Docker container, and copied the
</I>&gt;<i> challenge file from the disposable AppVM to the staging AppVM. I also
</I>&gt;<i> downloaded
</I>&gt;<i> EFF's long wordlist:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BEGIN COMPUTATION STEPS
</I>&gt;<i> ```````````````````````
</I>&gt;<i> I rolled a dice to select one of the four remaining USB drives at random. I
</I>&gt;<i> attached the USB drive to my Qubes laptop, and then redirected it from
</I>&gt;<i> sys-usb
</I>&gt;<i> to the staging AppVM using qubes-usb on Dom0. I copied the challenge file,
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> compute binary, and the wordlist to the USB drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I took the compute node, Tails USB drive, and challenge USB drive to a room
</I>&gt;<i> at
</I>&gt;<i> the far end of the house (from the router), which had the most line-of-sight
</I>&gt;<i> granite surrounding it, and also had a large metal filing cabinet. I emptied
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> of the drawers and set up the compute node inside it. I inserted the Tails
</I>&gt;<i> USB
</I>&gt;<i> drive, started the compute node, and disabled SecureBoot. Once in the Tails
</I>&gt;<i> environment, I inserted the challenge USB drive, copied the compute binary
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> wordlist to the Tails home directory (in RAM), and symlinked the challenge
</I>&gt;<i> file
</I>&gt;<i> into that directory (as I didn't have enough RAM to hold the challenge file
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> memory twice).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I started the compute binary, opened the wordlist, and then used five dice
</I>&gt;<i> (of
</I>&gt;<i> assorted sizes, that I scrounged from around the house) in a cardboard box
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> generate an eight-word random phrase. I typed the phrase into the compute
</I>&gt;<i> binary
</I>&gt;<i> input (space-separated, no leading or trailing spaces), and also wrote it
</I>&gt;<i> down
</I>&gt;<i> on the inside of a piece of folded card. I then started the computation
</I>&gt;<i> process,
</I>&gt;<i> and closed the filing cabinet drawer. The computation took around 40
</I>&gt;<i> minutes,
</I>&gt;<i> during which I sat beside it, occasionally pulling the drawer open slightly
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> check progress, and reading Serious Cryptography in between. At the point
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that the challenge itself had been read into memory, I unmounted
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> removed the challenge USB drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After the computation was completed, I rolled a dice to select one of the
</I>&gt;<i> three
</I>&gt;<i> remaining USB drives at random. I copied the response file to it, and used
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> phone to tweet out the BLAKE2b hash printed by the compute binary:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2c052c1f 039810e7 69779017 9943bdb9
</I>&gt;<i>     d00a84fb 25593453 85af3826 1fbe061c
</I>&gt;<i>     4dc79f4e 87da26f4 3202bcf4 3960db16
</I>&gt;<i>     be870511 7f3de50c 8922b502 32a3e126
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I then shut down the compute node.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> END COMPUTATION STEPS
</I>&gt;<i> `````````````````````
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I repeated the steps above a second time (using the two remaining USB
</I>&gt;<i> drives),
</I>&gt;<i> to obtain a second response file, and a second BLAKE2b hash:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     3df44b57 4c66cb75 9bba2f2a 96b12ea1
</I>&gt;<i>     9037a70c 4c898397 35ad6b3d 50b84715
</I>&gt;<i>     39bfdea2 0d6e6db3 79ce6f3d 3d823d32
</I>&gt;<i>     901d2651 20481863 45d99475 e63a91a9
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I rolled a dice to decide which of the two responses to upload; the
</I>&gt;<i> dice landed on an odd number, meaning that I uploaded the first response. I
</I>&gt;<i> am
</I>&gt;<i> revealing the randomness used to compute the second response:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     boogeyman amber reverse oversight scorn impending wheat engraver
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After typing in the above phrase, I burned the card on which I had written
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> two random phrases. I opened up the compute node, and removed the battery
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> RAM stick. I have not yet destroyed the RAM chips, and am keeping the stick
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> my person until I am able to (so I've probably damaged it already with
</I>&gt;<i> static).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I connected the USB drive containing the first response to my Qubes laptop,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> then redirected it from sys-usb to the staging AppVM. I then copied the
</I>&gt;<i> response
</I>&gt;<i> to the disposable AppVM, and then into another AppVM to upload it to one of
</I>&gt;<i> my
</I>&gt;<i> personal servers (as the upload to AWS was timing out).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Security Considerations
</I>&gt;<i> =======================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - The laptop was chosen randomly, with as little unreported bias as
</I>&gt;<i> possible,
</I>&gt;<i>   and with my participation at that point only mentioned to Sean. However, a
</I>&gt;<i>   sufficiently-motivated adversary could potentially have figured out that I
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i>   participating, guessed which store I would go to on my route, and
</I>&gt;<i> persuaded
</I>&gt;<i>   the staff to alter the displays to draw my attention towards a particular
</I>&gt;<i>   laptop. A constraint, or a private deterministic metric for selection, may
</I>&gt;<i>   have helped to eliminate more bias.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Using a deterministically-built ISO for the operating system should make
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i>   easier to determine the OS code that was running at the time, modulo the
</I>&gt;<i> trust
</I>&gt;<i>   in the machine that the live USB was built on (which is my Zcash dev
</I>&gt;<i> laptop).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Using a fresh Qubes AppVM for staging increases the bar for having
</I>&gt;<i> compromised
</I>&gt;<i>   the OS in order to compromise the challenge USB drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Tails by default disables sudo and mounts itself as read-only, meaning
</I>&gt;<i> that a
</I>&gt;<i>   malicious userspace process shouldn't be able to persist data on that USB
</I>&gt;<i>   drive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Tails by default mounts plugged-in USB drives as read-write. Using a
</I>&gt;<i> fresh USB
</I>&gt;<i>   drive each time to transfer the compute binary, challenge and wordlist to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>   compute node removed that as a vector for persistance between iterations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Revealing the randomness in the unused response, after the compute node
</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i>   been shut down, should make it possible to ascertain that the compute
</I>&gt;<i> binary
</I>&gt;<i>   was behaving correctly, by having third parties independently re-compute
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>   corresponding response file and verify the hash against the one I
</I>&gt;<i> published.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things I'd Do Differently In Future
</I>&gt;<i> ===================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Pick somewhere with faster internet. The internet here isn't snappy to
</I>&gt;<i> begin
</I>&gt;<i>   with, and it was raining and blowing which significantly impacts speeds.
</I>&gt;<i> As a
</I>&gt;<i>   result, the challenge file took several hours to download, and the
</I>&gt;<i> response
</I>&gt;<i>   file took probably double that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Use a DVD to set up the compute OS instead of a USB (and then load the
</I>&gt;<i> OS into
</I>&gt;<i>   RAM to free up the DVD drive). A DVD would in theory be more easily
</I>&gt;<i> auditable,
</I>&gt;<i>   putting less trust in the machine creating it than the live USB. This
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i>   also increase the amount of RAM required in the machine (I ran this
</I>&gt;<i> entirely
</I>&gt;<i>   in 4GB memory).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Build the compute binary ahead of time. In particular, the time it took
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i>   download Docker and build dependencies (twice) significantly extended the
</I>&gt;<i>   setup time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - The binary was built deterministically, but it would be preferable to
</I>&gt;<i> have it
</I>&gt;<i>   only use dependencies and a compiler that could be reasonably assumed to
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i>   have backdoors targeted at the MPC in general or participants in
</I>&gt;<i> particular. I
</I>&gt;<i>   did briefly try to compile Devrandom's branch, but decided determinism was
</I>&gt;<i>   more important for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Monitor and keyboard. I had to open the filing cabinet drawer in order
</I>&gt;<i> to type
</I>&gt;<i>   in the randomness and monitor progress; an external monitor and keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i>   limit the EM leakage of doing so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Hardware separation of randomness. There was maybe 10 minutes between
</I>&gt;<i>   compute iterations (as I created the second challenge USB drive), and the
</I>&gt;<i>   battery was not removed in between (as that required disassembly), so
</I>&gt;<i> there is
</I>&gt;<i>   a small but non-zero possibility that the second computation could have
</I>&gt;<i> been
</I>&gt;<i>   influenced by (maliciously or otherwise) the first one. In this case it
</I>&gt;<i>   happens to not matter much, as the random roll at the end selected the
</I>&gt;<i> result
</I>&gt;<i>   of the first computation, but in a future MPC I'd prefer to at least
</I>&gt;<i> remove
</I>&gt;<i>   the battery in between runs, and ideally swap out the RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Different response extraction mechanism. I neglected to purchase a DVD
</I>&gt;<i> reader
</I>&gt;<i>   for my existing laptops, so could not use DVDs as the airgap mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i>   falling back to the USB drives. I also had a more ambitious mechanism in
</I>&gt;<i> mind,
</I>&gt;<i>   but that will require significant additional development work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - - Use a separate AppVM for staging the response. I had intended to do this
</I>&gt;<i> (to
</I>&gt;<i>   limit the ability of any malicious data hidden on the response USB to
</I>&gt;<i> escape),
</I>&gt;<i>   but reused the previous qubes-usb command neglecting to change the AppVM
</I>&gt;<i> name.
</I>&gt;<i>   Once it was connected to the challenge staging VM, I decided that any
</I>&gt;<i> damage
</I>&gt;<i>   had already been done, and continued.
