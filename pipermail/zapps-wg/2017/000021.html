</I>
Ditto

&gt;<i> Many of us are solving #2 by performing the computations on hardware

</I>
I also agree that this is easily achieved.

While ~all the hardware we have available to us is likely backdoored, the bad
guys can't backdoor the laws of physics.

&gt;<i> However, we don't really have a good handle on #3. Right now,
</I>&gt;<i> participants are using the `powersoftau` code that I've written in
</I>&gt;<i> Rust. It is possible to change the code or even make an alternative
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, but that only gets you so far. You still have to hope
</I>&gt;<i> your OS/compiler/hardware are not backdoored.
</I>
So to be clear, a simple example of such a backdoor attack would be to take the
secret k that was supposed to be used in the computation and replace it with
truncate(k,n), where n is low enough to brute force, and high enough to not get
caught by the birthday paradox; something like 24-bits is probably feasible.
The attacker would then brute-force the truncated k from the transcripts,
recovering the toxic waste.

&gt;<i> I think there's a nice solution to this problem which is inspired by
</I>&gt;<i> an idea that Brian Warner had.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, the code I've written takes some randomness from the system
</I>&gt;<i> and mixes it with some user-supplied randomness. Instead, imagine
</I>&gt;<i> using randomness supplied by the participant exclusively. (One way the
</I>&gt;<i> participant can obtain it is with a boggle set.)
</I>
Note that this is better described as a user-supplied *secret*


Q: What exactly happens if one participant fails to destroy that secret and/or
inputs a low-entropy secret? What about N participants?

The paper states that &quot;We show that security holds even if an adversary has
limited influence on the beacon.&quot; but it's unclear what exactly &quot;limited
influence&quot; means.

&gt;<i> The trick is that the participant performs the computation N times,
</I>&gt;<i> each time with different randomness. This produces N response files.
</I>&gt;<i> Now, the participant randomly chooses N-1 of the response files and
</I>&gt;<i> reveals the randomness for them, and destroys the randomness of the
</I>&gt;<i> last response file -- which is their contribution to the ceremony. The
</I>&gt;<i> participant (and the general public) can perform the computations
</I>&gt;<i> again on their machines to check that the same response files are
</I>&gt;<i> produced for the ones we've revealed randomness for.
</I>
To be exact, what you mean to say here is that by re-doing the computations on
a trusted setup implementation that is *not* backdoored, you can detect the
existence of the backdoor because the results won't match.

&gt;<i> As N increases, the probability that any backdoor in the code,
</I>&gt;<i> compiler, hardware, operating system etc. could have tampered with the
</I>&gt;<i> entropy approaches zero. Now there is just one remaining problem: how
</I>&gt;<i> do we get the response files out of the machine without the backdoor
</I>&gt;<i> potentially sneaking the entropy over the channel?
</I>
As N increases you open up a new exfiltration route: the unused N-1 responses
could themselves be the exfiltration route, and thus need to be
deterministically verified against the N-1 unused secrets. This isn't
particularly user-friendly, and it's easy to imagine how this could be skipped.


I'd suggest instead that we ask participants to simply run the computation N&gt;1
times, and pick at random which output to actually use. If they re-use hardware
for each run, ask them to do their best at wiping all non-volatile memory; if
they have the ability to use different hardware for each run, even better.

Note that a variety of procedures to pick outputs at random are desirable. For
example, one person might decide to flip a coin after each run, and stop when
it comes up tails; another might do something different. Diversity is good.

After they've completed their runs, simply upload one or more dummy runs and
associated initial secrets for peer auditing, as well as their official
contribution.


Secondly, once we do get some dummy runs, I'd suggest that future participants
consider testing their compute nodes against those challenges and secrets to
verify that they also get the same results.


Finally, it's interesting how there's a whole class of &quot;sham&quot; participant
strategies, where someone who runs the computation and uploads an audit
response w/ revealed secret, but does not actually participate in that round,
still frustrates attackers who can not tell in advance if that particular
participant will or will not actually participate. This suggests that the
current round's challenge should be made public.

&gt;<i> DVDs are a good
</I>&gt;<i> approach if it's possible to create many of them and then analyze them
</I>&gt;<i> for any differences or hidden information.
</I>
The experience of the previous trusted setup is that no-one bothers to audit
evidence collected after the fact. For example, I appear to have been the
*only* non-Zcash team member who ever bothered to even do the basic step of
recreating the deterministic builds, readily apparent by the fact that they
were broken about a month after the setup due to two different (still unfixed)
bugs in the deterministic build scripts(1). So I'd be cautious about putting
too much emphasis on &quot;paranoid measures&quot; like this when there are more
fundamental attack vectors to solve.


In any case for this to be effective you really need to completely fill the
storage medium with a known pattern. You also need to bypass standard
filesystems, which contain massive amounts of metadata in the form of file
timestamps and the like - better to write a single file to the medium, and fill
the rest with zeros.

As I noted after the prior trusted setup, CD's/DVD's/etc. are *not* read-only
once written, as the writable medium can continue to be written to after the
initial data has been written to it. This means that an attacker could create a
DVD that, e.g., compromises the drive at a firmware level, exfiltrates the
secret, and then uses the laser in the DVD reader to erase the evidence.

But as this setup is multi-participant, this can easily be defeated by using a
wide variety of techniques. For instance, it turns out that USB drives with
(allegedly) hardware write-protect switches are readily available, such as the
Kanguru FlashBlu series:

<A HREF="https://store.kanguru.com/pages/flash-blu-2">https://store.kanguru.com/pages/flash-blu-2</A>

Secondly, using a semi-trusted &quot;firewall&quot; machine that reads the medium, and
then copies it to a new medium can also avoid unintended data leaks between
those two mediums.

&gt;<i> (The original idea that Brian and Zooko briefly considered for the
</I>&gt;<i> Zcash ceremony last year was similar, except it involved one of the
</I>&gt;<i> participants revealing all their entropy at the end, and the rest
</I>&gt;<i> destroying theirs. This is because the previous protocol couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> support participants performing multiple computations, because they
</I>&gt;<i> had to commit to their entropy at the very beginning. The new protocol
</I>&gt;<i> does support participants performing multiple computations with
</I>&gt;<i> different entropy, though!)
</I>
Looks like both myself and Saleem Rashid had similar ideas as well, so either
it's a good one or we're all wrong. :)
