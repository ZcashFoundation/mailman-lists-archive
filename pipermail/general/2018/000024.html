<PRE>Hello everyone, happy December! We hope that whatever fall or winter
holidays you celebrate have been, and will continue to be, full of joy.

November was certainly a joyful month for the Zcash Foundation. We
announced the winners of the 2018Q2 Grants Program:
<A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/q2-grant-winners/">https://z.cash.foundation/blog/q2-grant-winners/</A>

We also announced that we're funding Aditya Kulkarni's zec-qt-wallet, a
cross-platform GUI wallet that includes a full node, as well as a new iOS
wallet to be created by Justin Smith:
<A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation/blog/wallet-agreements/">https://z.cash.foundation/blog/wallet-agreements/</A>

We helped sponsor a zk-proofs workshop in London:

And the Foundation is among the sponsors of an upcoming event on Wednesday
called Blockchain Against Evil:
<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-against-evil-tickets-52069749021">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-against-evil-tickets-52069749021</A>
(tickets are still available!)

Last month we wrote: &quot;Throughout the month, behind the scenes, we continued
conversations about revamping the Grants Program and coordinating with the
Zcash Company on standards and development work. We also continued
evaluating several potential partnerships that are still too early or
tentative to share in public.&quot; That remains true.

December is likely to be a slow month, but we'll have more exciting news to
share in Q1 and Q2 of 2019.

A question about this monthly summary email: We've been focusing on
tangible public progress that the Zcash Foundation made in a given month.
Would you prefer more operational details? (The operational details tend to
be, &quot;The team sent a lot of emails and did some phone calls,&quot; so that might
not be interesting.) News about the general Zcash ecosystem? No guarantees
that we'll shift format, but feedback is welcome!
