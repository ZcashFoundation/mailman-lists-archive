<PRE>Hello everyone! I hope you're having a lovely August so far. Apologies for
the delay in sending this email &#8212; I was tied up with the Decentralized Web
Summit last week. But I'll tell you about that next month in the August
recap :)

After a very eventful June, the Foundation spent July getting our feet back
under us. There's a lot going on internally that we're not ready to
announce, except in broad strokes: We're continuing to work on hiring,
technical partnerships, the grants program, and an overhaul of our web
presence.

Notable July events:

&#8212; On the 3rd, we published the Foundation's interpretation of the results
from our governance process, including thoughts on how to improve it next
time: <A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation//blog/governance-results/">https://z.cash.foundation//blog/governance-results/</A>

&#8212; On the 10th, we weighed in on the Zcash Ecosystem Fund controversy:
<A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation//blog/founders-reward/">https://z.cash.foundation//blog/founders-reward/</A>

&#8212; On the 12th, we published a comprehensive Zcon0 recap with lots of links:
<A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation//blog/zcon0-recap/">https://z.cash.foundation//blog/zcon0-recap/</A>

&#8212; On the 26th, we were pleased to see Bitmain take further steps toward
transparency:
<A HREF="https://blog.bitmain.com/en/transparency-policy-shipping-mining-practices/">https://blog.bitmain.com/en/transparency-policy-shipping-mining-practices/</A>

Bitmain's announcement is worth including because it was formulated, at
least in part, as a response to our June request that hardware
manufacturers start sharing more metrics:
<A HREF="https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hardware-transparency/">https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hardware-transparency/</A> (we know this for
certain from conversations with Bitmain staff)

A few additional items from the wider world of Zcash...

Billy Garrison blogged about how and why to participate in the Sapling MPC:

BitGo added Zcash support! &quot;BitGo isn't a run-of-the-mill ZCash
implementation &#8212; this is the FIRST multi-signature ZCash wallet. Technical
folks will know that multi-sig in ZCash is different from other blockchains
and it does affect privacy. But finally &#8212; a secure platform for ZCash is
here!&quot; &#8212; BitGo CEO Mike Belshe:

Coinbase might add support for $ZEC, a possibility summed up in a Zcash
Company blog post: <A HREF="https://blog.z.cash/coinbase-exploring-zcash/">https://blog.z.cash/coinbase-exploring-zcash/</A>

Reply to this email if you have any specific questions and I'll be happy to
provide whatever additional details I can! Thank you.
