<PRE>Dear Community members,


Just brief update from the Coincentrix Team. We are moving forward into the accordance with the schedule we have laid out in the grant.

Since the beginning of the year planning and workshop material have been created to meet the goals of the project. We have chosen 4 pilot schools with a possibility of 2 additional schools. Also we are doing a joint presentation with a local non profit organization in Birmingham Alabama at the town public library to reach awareness to local community members and college students.We have our first order of Zcash foundation shirts to arrive as well as identified ambassadors at the 4 chosen schools to start the organizing of the events.

This month we have had calls with Andrew and Linda from Guarda to discuss points on the development of their ZCASH wallet and also  Josh Cincinnati to discuss our project progress, next steps and technical overview. In Birmingham Alabama this month we have 2 back to back presentations at University of Alabama Birmingham and Bessemer Public Library. We invited 2  local experts in the crypto space to come speak regarding mining and investments to involve local blockchain entrepreneurs and businesses. We believe local involvement by blockchain entrepreneurs, businesses and  enthusiasts is the key success tool to spread massive grassroots adoption of Zcash.

For February we are on the active pursuit to push Zcash adoption sticking to our schedule and involving all fundamental parts of the blockchain ecosystem. We are scheduled to have calls with Jason davis and radix to get additional highlights on our presentation material as well as engage actively in the Zcash community.


I'll put all valuable updates here as well as Zcash forums to actively in the Zcash community!
