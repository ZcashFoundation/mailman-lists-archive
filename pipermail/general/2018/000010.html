<PRE>
On April 26th, 2018 we were invited by Dr. Chance Glenn the Dean of the College of Engineering at Alabama A&amp;M University to participate and provide a 1-hour presentation on Zcash and Blockchain Fundamentals for the Dean Speaker Series. It was an opportunity for residents within Huntsville, AL and other areas of Madison County to share ideas, lessons learned, and listen to important topics from invited speakers within the Southern region. This event was featured as a spotlight on WAFF 48, a local news station, and promoted by Alabama A&amp;M University&#8217;s public relations department. This event attracted a crowd of more than 100 people that consisted of faculty, students, and community business and residents. Attendees were excited to be exposed to Zcash and Blockchain technology that led to a lengthy Q&amp;A segment that last an hour. Attendees asked questions such as &#8220;How do you see Zcash be utilized in everyday transactions? &#8221;The Dean Speakers Series concluded with additional conversations about innovation and new opportunities that included integrating Zcash and Blockchain technology into student projects and course material within the College of Engineering. Several faculty members and residents from the community inquired about additional information and future collaborations. Below are several pictures from the Dean Speaker Series.
