<PRE>Hey all,

&#160;
Our Zcash mission:

&#160;
Enable you to pay for goods and services at brick-and-mortar stores using shielded Zcash! More importantly, to give business owners and cashiers instant peace-of-mind that they were paid the correct amount by a customer. They will feel secure and confident even if the customer paid with super secret zcash and even if&#160;the merchant does not have their wallet handy.

&#160;
In March, the dream became a lot closer to reality. Now that the ZecWallet is available, users can actually pay from a mobile device instead of lugging around their laptops to pay with shielded Zcash &#8212; not very practical! Our engineers&#160;successfully paid test invoices using shielded Zcash using the ZecWallet! This is exactly the way it would work in stores.

&#160;
Thanks to the work completed this month, our developers can now send successful test payments to a merchant who has a Z-address set or a T-address set. 

&#160;
But what if the merchant wants to present the customer with a t-address? After all, if the customer is using Coinomi or some other wallet, they probably can&#8217;t pay a Z-address, even if they wanted to. 

&#160;
That is the challenge for April: Allow a merchant to set which type of address to display to the customer so that everyone who wants to can pay with Zcash, not just the super cool people like you who have the ZecWallet.

&#160;
Best,

&#160;
Derrick J. Freeman
