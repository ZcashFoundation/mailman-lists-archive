<PRE>Hi,

This is the first status report on GrantProposals-2018Q2 #25 &quot;review,
tweaks, and maybe design of a new PoW scheme for Zcash.&quot;

<A HREF="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25">https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25</A>

The tentative schedule starts with (quoting from the proposal):

- Getting up to speed and research on original Dagger Hashimoto and the
  codebase the current implementation of ProgPoW has been forked from

This is actually what I've been working on - reading up on Dagger
Hashimoto and on Ethash on Ethereum wiki and on related topics elsewhere
(e.g., papers, Sergio Demian Lerner's blog, discussions on reddit) -
learned a few things I had missed, found similarities and differences
between my own independent thinking (as I was into CPU-focused
algorithms lately, searching for the holy grail of sequential
memory-hardness combined with DoS resistance and/or fast(er)
verification) and Sergio's memohash paper's &quot;Gradual verification&quot; and
what the Ethereum project arrived at with their Ethash.

The next item in the tentative schedule is:

- If no show-stoppers are identified up to that point, then further review of
  ProgPoW and proposal/testing/tuning of its modifications (in particular, its
  &quot;instruction set&quot; will almost certainly be revised, and probably more)

I haven't approached this directly yet as I wanted to improve my own
knowledge first and I intend to approach this in a systematic manner.
However, I noticed others already bring up related issues and make
related suggestions - in particular, on GitHub and on ProgPoW Discord
(where I was invited to, and joined [my first Discord ever]) by
@SChernykh and @chfast, whose work I appreciate:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/16">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/16</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/19">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/19</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/20">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/20</A>
<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/21">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/21</A>

Another item in the tentative schedule is:

- CPU-only implementation of the chosen PoW scheme (we're currently unaware of
  one for ProgPoW) for research and testing (e.g., for randomness tests on its
  memory dumps, and for tweaks to improve such randomness)

I asked on the ProgPoW Discord and learned that there's already a
CPU-only implementation in Go embedded in this tree:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/go-ethereum">https://github.com/ifdefelse/go-ethereum</A>

Later in the project, I'll need to decide on whether to extract and use
the Go implementation from there or maybe make a new one in C, or maybe
there will already be more options.

Finally, the tentative project plan includes:

- Optionally, purchase and installation of new GPUs and required software

Since Zcash Foundation chose to fund this proposed upgrade of Openwall's
HPC Village (&quot;a project of Openwall where we provide Open Source
developers with remote access to a system with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, and
Intel Xeon Phi&quot;) - thanks! - we looked into the currently available and
reasonable upgrade options and ended up ordering a GTX 1080 (a short
enough card to use a slot that we didn't have other good use for, so we
can leave more other GPUs in the machine) and a Vega 64 to be installed
later in January.  Initially, I wanted to get the new RTX 2080 Ti, but
was advised against that for now (so maybe later) in this tweet thread:

<A HREF="https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/1077577386617700353">https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/1077577386617700353</A>

(I omitted from this update parts of the proposal for which there's
nothing to report yet.)

Unexpectedly, I also ended up looking into Equihash parameters and
making suggestions again, as it appears Zcash's temporary second PoW for
Blossom will be merely another Equihash instantiation, and this needs to
be decided on ASAP:

[Blossom NU] Write spec for Harmony Mining
<A HREF="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3672">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3672</A>

whereas the work more obviously falling under this grant will probably
fit under:

choose new PoW for Zcash 4.0 (NU3)
<A HREF="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3761">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3761</A>

I am watching both of these issues.  In the current discussion on
Equihash parameters, I especially appreciated comments by @tromp on
BEAM's use of modified 150,5 and by @mineZcash on teardown of Z9's
BM1740 chip - it's two important developments I had missed.

We also spent (wasted?) _plenty_ of time on KYC procedures for
&quot;institutional&quot; accounts with two reputable cryptocurrency/fiat
exchanges, so that we could cash this grant money out to a business bank
account.  As the cryptocurrency prices were rapidly declining, this felt
like a priority, but in the end the KYC procedures took so much time
(and there's still no decision on setup of the accounts - still waiting)
that this didn't really matter (or maybe we should have given up and
used a personal account, or some other option) - the market appears to
have reached and bounced from a strong(er) support level in December.
As a result, we still have no fiat from this grant (yet have already
started spending fiat on the GPUs above), and its current dollar value
is a lot less than what was awarded.  Anyway, that's our problem, and
we're grateful to Zcash Foundation for running the program and awarding
the grant.

A silver lining of having the grant awarded in ZEC is that I ended up
playing with real funds on Sapling addresses, and reported this bug:

Partial balance temporarily shown after transaction on a fully synced node
<A HREF="https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3746">https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3746</A>

So I certainly can see how awarding grants in ZEC helps improve and
promote Zcash.

Thanks,

Alexander
