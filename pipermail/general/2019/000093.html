<PRE>Hi,

The grant recipients are expected to deliver and post in here &quot;a more
comprehensive report 6 months after receiving funding&quot;, so here's one
for this project summarizing the 6 monthly reports.  It's also posted
on GitHub with more hyperlinks:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25#issuecomment-513876705">https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25#issuecomment-513876705</A>

Executive summary and personal impression:

The project validated ProgPoW, improved understanding of its strengths
and weaknesses, provided a plain C implementation of it, slightly
cleaned up the upstream GPU implementation, and identified areas for
further tweaks.  Overall, ProgPoW is viable, but its use of GPU compute
resources is far from optimal and its biggest advantage over Ethash
isn't its &quot;programmability&quot; but rather its different than Ethash's reads
from the DAG.  The design and implementation of ProgPoW could both still
use some invasive tweaks and enhancements for much better results, but
the community's motivation to work on those (or even to accept them)
appears to have waned.  It's hard to stay motivated not knowing whether
one's work would actually be made use of (by a major project like
Ethereum) or not, and it's hard not to declare development done and not
to move on since ProgPoW was introduced (with much enthusiasm) over a
year ago.  People appear to have mostly moved on.

Monthly technical reports and their summaries:

1. <A HREF="000031.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000031.html</A>

- Getting up to speed with ProgPoW and its heritage

- Purchase of new GPUs (GTX 1080 and Vega 64)

- Looking into Equihash parameters and making suggestions on them (as
  Zcash's temporary second PoW for Blossom could be merely another
  Equihash instantiation, and this needed to be decided on ASAP)

2. <A HREF="000047.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000047.html</A>

- Installation and testing of the new GPUs and required software (added
  the GPUs to Openwall's HPC Village available to Open Source developers
  worldwide)

- Experiments with ProgPoW vs. Ethash on the new and older GPUs
  resulting in &quot;Build instructions&quot; and &quot;Benchmark results&quot;

3. <A HREF="000061.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000061.html</A>

- Put together c-progpow, a plain C implementation of ProgPoW, based
  on upstream's README.md and more

- More experiments with ProgPoW on the GPUs with some tweaking,
  getting it to match performance figures that others reported to have a
  proper baseline for further work

4. <A HREF="000073.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000073.html</A>

- Analysis of how little use of the multipliers ProgPoW makes
  (estimated as 68x lower than the theoretical peak throughput of FP32
  multiplies would be on the Vega 64)

- Getting on the same page with @ifdefelse on the set of issues and
  constraints for starting to use floating-point

- With incompatible ProgPoW tweaks, got a 3x+ speedup on Titan X
  Maxwell (up from 4.0M to 12.3M or even to 12.5M) at a cost of maybe a
  3.5% slowdown on GTX 1080 (down from 15.15M to 14.6M)

- Looked into and commented on Linzhi's planned Ethash ASICs and their
  (flawed) evaluation of ProgPoW

- Realized that the biggest advantage ProgPoW has over Ethash has
  nothing to do with its &quot;programmability&quot;, but is probably @mbevand's
  finding and fix that got into ProgPoW 0.9.1+ to prevent splitting the
  memory across multiple ASIC dies without requiring the full bandwidth
  between the dies

5. <A HREF="000082.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000082.html</A>

- Thought of and experimented with a floating-point hack of ProgPoW,
  and arrived at some conclusions

- While staying with integers only, managed to get to a (geometric)
  middle point between official

- ProgPoW's MUL/s rate and theoretical maximum FP32 MUL/s rate: ~7x
  higher than original, but still ~9x lower than theoretical maximum

- Started to maintain an unofficial fork of ProgPoW with a more
  elaborate revision of the NVIDIA Maxwell speedup tweak in the
  &quot;maxwell&quot; branch

- Also added to the branch and proposed for inclusion upstream &quot;Index
  cache with byte offsets&quot;, which provides a 1% speedup on new GPUs (and
  2% speedup on Maxwell) with no ill effects

- Arrived at an opinion on and brought up for discussion with upstream
  Make cache content vary per-hash

6. <A HREF="000089.html">/pipermail/general/2019/000089.html</A>

- Wrote debugging code as a hack to upstream ProgPoW

- Proceeded with additional correctness testing of ProgPoW upstream
  implementation against c-progpow and of upstream's CUDA against OpenCL

- Uncovered issues with the OpenCL implementation: the kernel was
  being built for a wrong ProgPoW period most of the time (a bug in
  ProgPoW), and further it was often miscompiled when targeting AMD GPUs
  (a bug in AMD's &quot;driver&quot;)

- Got 5 PRs merged into upstream ProgPoW, including 2 fixing the
  issues mentioned above
