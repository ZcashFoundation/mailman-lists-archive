<PRE>Hello all,

&#160;
We at Anypay are making it possible to pay with shielded Zcash at stores.

&#160;
In January we focussed on reliability. We built several rigorous automated tests that measure speed and success rates. Using these tools we brought the speed of generating a Zcash invoice down from 3 seconds to 1 second. We brought the speed of recognizing an invoice has been paid from 10 seconds to 3 second. These are under ideal scenarios of solid internet connection. The time each takes to register on your screen depends on your connection and device, but generally these speed of generating and paying a Zcash invoice on Anypay takes the same amount of time as using a credit card (and uses a cool digital signature rather than an easily forgeable written one).

&#160;
In February, we are continuing development. January&#8217;s tests revealed that we needed to change the way we monitored and relayed payments to improve speed and most importantly reliability. Since Anypay supports payments in a handful of cryptocurrencies, that means adjusting the code for each one. Zcash is among them. This will be February&#8217;s goal: making sure Zcash payments (transparent style) happen as quickly and reliably as all the other coins on our platform.

&#160;
Once that important goal is achieved, we can add to the complexity with shielded transactions. For now, we are taking small, manageable chunks and making progress little by little to ensure everything keeps working without interruption to our many active users.

&#160;
Best,

&#160;
