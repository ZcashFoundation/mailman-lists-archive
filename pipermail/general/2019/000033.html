<PRE>Hello all,

&#160;
We at AnyPay are making it possible to pay with shielded ZCash at stores.

&#160;
In December we focussed on improving reliability. The time it takes to generate an invoice is now about 10 times faster than it was last month, making the payment experience at checkout faster than using paper cash or a credit card. Users can also reliably create crypto invoices priced in all of 161 different international currencies. Support for ZCash was temporarily disabled while a potential vulnerability in our payment relay service is being investigated and remedied. We will return ZCash as a payment option as soon as possible.

&#160;
In January we are building several rigorous automated tests that we are implementing to ensure total measurable and provable reliability. While we do this, it puts the development of shielded ZCash transactions on hold. What good is a payment system that fails even 0.1% of the time? You deserve a dependable service. You should be confident it will work every time. So January is totally focussed on that. Reliability.

&#160;
We look forward to making shielded ZCash payments in stores soon.

&#160;
Best,

&#160;
Derrick

ANYPAY
