<PRE>Hey all,

&#160;
Our Zcash mission:

&#160;
Enable you to pay for goods and services at brick-and-mortar stores using shielded Zcash! More importantly, to give business owners and cashiers instant peace-of-mind that they were paid the correct amount by a customer. They will feel secure and confident even if the customer paid with super secret zcash and even if&#160;the merchant does not have their wallet handy.

In February, we&#160;progressed toward this goal. We are closing in, and the end is in sight.&#160;Our engineers&#160;successfully paid test invoices using shielded Zcash.

&#160;
In test one,&#160;Zcash was successfully sent from a shielded address to a shielded address and was detected by our system, resulting in a delightful &quot;PAID&quot; message. This means you can pay for goods&#160;using shielded Zcash and have it end up in the merchant's wallet still in its shielded form. Pretty cool.

&#160;
In test two,&#160;Zcash was successfully&#160;sent from a transparent address to a&#160;shielded address, and bang -- same thing. The monitor correctly recognized payment to the Z-address.&#160;This means that a merchant can set a shielded address for their business, and their customers can pay them with transparent or shielded Zcash, and it will not matter which they send -- it will all end up as shielded Zcash in their wallet.&#160;

&#160;
There is a little&#160;configuring we have to do with our API&#160;to make sure the PAID screen appears with&#160;payments to z-addresses.

&#160;
Best,
&#160;
Derrick J. Freeman
