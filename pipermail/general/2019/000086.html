Also on the Construct stage at Consensus, Zcash Foundation board member
Peter Van Valkenburgh said, &quot;As a director of the Zcash Foundation I don't
want Zcash developers to build a system that maximizes the value of Zcash.
I want them to build the best damn privacy coin they can. That's the
problem with a fiduciary duty of loyalty.&quot;
