<PRE>Hi,

This is another update on GrantProposals-2018Q2 #25 &quot;review, tweaks, and
maybe design of a new PoW scheme for Zcash.&quot;

<A HREF="https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25">https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/25</A>

On ProgPoW's (under-)use of GPUs' compute power:

I improved, cleaned up, and ran more tests of c-progpow, and used hacks
of it to run some simulations on ProgPoW as-is and on some potential
tweaks to it.  c-progpow now collects and prints some statistics on math
operations and memory accesses.

Using the statistics from c-progpow and a hashrate seen on Vega 64, I
calculated exactly how little use of the integer multipliers ProgPoW
makes.  If we set maximizing use of the multipliers on a given GPU as
our goal (which there are good reasons for), then the theoretical
potential for improvement on the Vega 64 may be up to 68x in terms of
arbitrary multiplies, which is a lot:

&quot;Make greater use of MADs&quot;
<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/34">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/34</A>

(On other GPUs it'd be similar.  I just needed to pick an example.)

However, there are plenty of issues and constraints that will likely
limit the improvement to a much lower figure.  On that GitHub issue, I
also brought up potential use of floating-point once again, and got
helpful responses from @ifdefelse.  I think we're on the same page
regarding the set of issues and constraints now.  Switching to use of
FP32 multiplies (or multiply-adds) might be the way to go for using the
multipliers optimally across a variety of GPUs, but it is really tricky
to do right.  For more detail, see comments on that issue.

On (repairing) Ethash's and ProgPoW's performance drop on older GPUs:

</I>
I experimented with it some more, and got success at recovering the
speed on NVIDIA Maxwell (aka GTX 9xx series GPUs, or two generations
behind from latest RTX 2xxx):

<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/26#issuecomment-480382319">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/26#issuecomment-480382319</A>

Specifically, combining a minor cleanup to untie the different
parameters, a parameters tweak, and a code hack (not yet final, but
works for proof-of-concept), I got a 3x+ speedup on Titan X Maxwell (up
from 4.0M to 12.3M or even to 12.5M) at a cost of maybe a 3.5% slowdown
on GTX 1080 (down from 15.15M to 14.6M).  This is at block number 7M.
I ask: &quot;Is this possibly adequate enough speed for some miners to
reconsider using Maxwell again?&quot;  I don't know the answer.  When I got
&quot;only&quot; a 65% speedup before, a miner quickly pointed out that they've
fully moved from Maxwell to Pascal by now, and performance increase on
Maxwell is irrelevant and isn't worth any (not even tiny) slowdown on
Pascal.  I don't know if other miners share this sentiment as well or
not.  Also, this sentiment might be specific to Ethereum miners, who had
to switch to newer GPUs by now, whereas miners of other altcoins might
not have had to, yet those altcoins might consider ProgPoW as well.

The maybe-slowdown of a few percent on some newer GPUs won't necessarily
persist along with this major speedup on Maxwell.  To me, ProgPoW isn't
otherwise final yet - I am considering many other tweaks - so performance
differences of a few percent might be premature to take seriously.

Disclaimer: in absence of test vectors for this revised code that we'd
compare against a pure host-side implementation, it's always possible
that I made some error and the code doesn't actually behave as I assume
it does, which would invalidate the benchmark results.  These results
are consistent with my expectations, and make sense to me, but they'd
need to be verified.

On Linzhi's Ethash ASICs and their (flawed) evaluation of ProgPoW:

A week ago, @Sonia-Chen from Linzhi made a lengthy Medium post and a
GitHub thread comment here:

<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/24#issuecomment-477998643">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/issues/24#issuecomment-477998643</A>

The analysis sort of claims that ProgPoW adds only on the order of 1%
of cost (die area, power) to ASICs, as compared to Ethash.  Further
comments in that thread (by others and by me) point out many flaws in
the analysis (some costs not considered, some numbers off by a factor of
4), so its result is indeed bogus.  However, the approach looks correct
to me, and with the flaws corrected it could show ProgPoW adding little -
just not that little - except for one major difference between Ethash
and ProgPoW that wasn't considered (more on it a few paragraphs below).

Linzhi also announced Ethash ASICs with truly impressive performance:

&quot;Ethash Miner Announcement, ETC Summit Seoul, September 2018
Specs: Ethash, 1400 MH/s, 1000 Watts, price commitment 4-6 months ROI.
Schedule: 12/2018 TapeOut, 04/2019 Samples, 06/2019 Mass Production.&quot;

This translates to a 10x'ish improvement in energy-efficiency over
current most suitable GPUs.  (BTW, this greatly exceeds ProgPoW
designers' expectation that only a ~2x improvement over GPUs would be
possible for Ethash.)

As I understand, and totally non-surprisingly, Linzhi haven't (yet?)
disclosed how they achieved that result.  Most notably, how they tackled
the memory bandwidth requirement of Ethash.  I posted several guesses to
that GitHub thread (maybe helping them or some other ASIC manufacturer,
even though I'm no ASIC expert) on how they might have achieved the
required external memory bandwidth or avoided the need.

I ended up with what I think is the most likely guess: they exploited
the optimization pointed out on Nov 15, 2018 by none other than Marc
Bevand (who wrote the SILENTARMY Zcash miner, the winning GPU entry to
Zcash's mining competition):

<A HREF="https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/pull/13">https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW/pull/13</A>

With this, an Ethash ASIC unit can split the memory across multiple ASIC
dies without requiring the full bandwidth between the dies.

ProgPoW 0.9.1+ includes a fix preventing this optimization.

I now think this tiny fix might very well be the biggest advantage
ProgPoW actually has over Ethash.  Everything else (including ProgPoW's
use of compute resources and its programmability) pales in comparison.
