<PRE>Hello everyone! We didn't send one of these emails at the end of December,
due to the holiday. December was effectively a half-month, because so many
people take vacation time at the end of the year (including Zcash
Foundation staff).

Without any further ado, the list of announcement-worthy Zcash Foundation
activities from the past two months!

The Foundation co-hosted and co-sponsored an event called Blockchain
Against Evil, which you can read about here:
<A HREF="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-against-evil-tickets-52069749021">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-against-evil-tickets-52069749021</A>
(click &quot;View Details&quot; for more information about the content)

Proceeds from the event were donated to Open Privacy, a fellow nonprofit
that focuses on securing people's privacy through technology:

We reorganized our website and GitHub repos to make information about the
Foundation and its doings more accessible:
<A HREF="https://www.zfnd.org/blog/website-refresh/">https://www.zfnd.org/blog/website-refresh/</A>

We worked with Ian Miers, who is a member of our Board (among numerous
other qualifications), to turn a talk about blockchain privacy theater into
a long-form article:
<A HREF="https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/blockchain-privacy-equal-parts-theory-and-theater">https://www.tokendaily.co/blog/blockchain-privacy-equal-parts-theory-and-theater</A>

The article will be posted on our website as well.

The Foundation is sponsoring an upcoming zk-SNARKs meetup in Tel Aviv:

We announced the details of Zcon1 (June 22 &#8211; 24 in Split, Croatia) and
asked people to start applying for invitations:

And finally, Executive Director Josh Cincinnatti wrote &quot;The State of the
Zcash Foundation in 2019,&quot; reviewing our performance in 2018 and setting
the course for the rest of the year:

Hopefully 2019 is treating you well so far! As always, if you have any
questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reply to this email.
