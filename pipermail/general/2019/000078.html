<PRE>Hello friends! As usual, here's the rundown of public-facing Zcash
Foundation activities. Getting ready for Zcon1 has been a big internal
focus, and preparations will continue until the event in late June.

4/9
Speaking of Zcon1, we published the speaker list and agenda, which is being
updated in real time:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hcsi2Bd0CNuUuPiCKMavHOByFMnTsKkM6_Rw165_oe8/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hcsi2Bd0CNuUuPiCKMavHOByFMnTsKkM6_Rw165_oe8/</A>

Apply for an invitation now, if you haven't already!

4/10
Blockgeeks published an interview with Zcash Foundation Executive Director
Josh Cincinnati: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jdfDMRfQQY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jdfDMRfQQY</A>

&gt;<i> Ameer Rosic sits down with Josh Cincinnati of the Zcash Foundation to
</I>talk privacy, censorship, and new payment technologies. Josh discusses the
importance of digital cash and anonymity in an increasingly digital world.
Other topics include threats to blockchain, stablecoins, and D.C. traffic.

4/10 &#8211; 4/12
The second ZKProof Standards workshop, sponsored by the Foundation (among
others), took place in early April. Foundation employees Josh Cincinnati,
Henry de Valence, Anna Kaplan, and Sonya Mann attended. We even had a
snazzy banner:
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/ZcashFoundation/status/1116010459411304448">https://twitter.com/ZcashFoundation/status/1116010459411304448</A>

Henry gave a talk called &quot;Tooling Infrastructure for Zero-Knowledge
Proofs&quot;:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WismT94w3Ho&amp;list=PLOEty2U8Y69VKX0THZvO_liqwV3Ngf1wt&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WismT94w3Ho&amp;list=PLOEty2U8Y69VKX0THZvO_liqwV3Ngf1wt&amp;index=6&amp;t=0s</A>

The rest of the videos are in that playlist, and you can find speaker
slides here: <A HREF="https://community.zkproof.org/t/zkproof-2019-speaker-slides/167">https://community.zkproof.org/t/zkproof-2019-speaker-slides/167</A>

The event was extremely high-quality, and it was wonderful to see the
growth of the zero-knowledge ecosystem.

4/16
We ran a meme contest to test out ZF Grants, and announced the winner:

Side note &#8212; we haven't created formal, fleshed-out RFPs yet, but we
published a list of promising ideas: <A HREF="https://www.zfnd.org/grants/">https://www.zfnd.org/grants/</A> (scroll
to &quot;Grant Ideas&quot;)

4/17
The Foundation will host an open discussion of the Zcash protocol on May
21:
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPXkdcfhMX7dmbNZxsHWM1-mDJu1HJMimKvq-AHRR6RKXDlA/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScPXkdcfhMX7dmbNZxsHWM1-mDJu1HJMimKvq-AHRR6RKXDlA/viewform</A>

The deadline is today, so the form will be closed sometime tomorrow morning
(Wednesday). If you want to participate, apply now.

4/22
Henry created a website for Merlin: <A HREF="https://merlin.cool/">https://merlin.cool/</A>

&gt;<i> Merlin is a STROBE-based transcript construction for zero-knowledge
</I>proofs. It automates the Fiat-Shamir transform, so that by using Merlin,
non-interactive protocols can be implemented as if they were interactive.

4/23
Another interview with Josh, this time by Underscore VC:
<A HREF="https://youtu.be/b2HL_K3-rwI">https://youtu.be/b2HL_K3-rwI</A>

&gt;<i> Underscore VC Co-Founder and Partner, Richard Dulude, sits down with Josh
</I>Cincinnati, Executive Director at Zcash Foundation, to talk about the
future of blockchain and the role the Zcash Foundation will play in it.

4/29
We're sponsoring a zero-knowledge meetup in London, which will take place
on May 1: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/Zero-Knowledge-London/events/260669657/">https://www.meetup.com/Zero-Knowledge-London/events/260669657/</A>

Dated 4/29 somewhat arbitrarily, because that's when organizer Louis
Guthmann tweeted about it:
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/GuthL/status/1122826159589339137">https://twitter.com/GuthL/status/1122826159589339137</A>

4/30
We announced that Zcon1 tickets will increase from $500 to $600 on May 22,
which is also the deadline for financial aid applications. Tweeted here:

That's it! Thank you for your time, as always. Also as always, questions
and comments are welcome!
