<PRE>After evaluating and contacting more artists this month, I believe that the
best fit (in terms both of commission price and artistic skill) for
creating the first two posters is an American artist based out of
Minnesota. (I'll share the artist's name once I finalize the commission
contract.) Unfortunately, the artist is in high demand and can only start
working on the Zcash posters on March 27. But we've been discussing ideas
over email in the meantime, so that the artist can jump right in on March
27.

In parallel, I'm contacting several more artists, including some from
outside of the United States.

I'm hoping that the first poster will be ready in April.

Subject: Grant Progress Report (January 2019): Zcash Posters
To: &lt;<A HREF="/mailman/listinfo/general">general at lists.zfnd.org</A>&gt;


The goal of this Zcash Posters project is to create a series of posters
that educate the public about the importance of financial privacy and
promote Zcash as an important tool for achieving financial privacy in the
future. 100% of the $2,500 grant will go to commissioning artists to design
the posters, and all the posters will be available to download for free.

An inspiration for this project are all the great World War II home front
posters developed in many different countries during that war.

Work on this project started this week. I have contacted three artists, and
I plan on contacting several more within the next few days.

The target audience of these posters is not cybercoin aficionados. Rather,
I am trying to target the general public. Someone seeing one of these
posters hanging in a restaurant, dorm room, or bus stop should be motivated
to learn more about Zcash; that is the goal.

To conclude this update, below is an excerpt of an email that I sent to one
of the artists. The excerpt will give you a better sense of what I'm trying
to accomplish with this project.

*I've been thinking about those great WWII posters that encourage citizens
to keep quiet:*

*Seymour R. Goff, &quot;Loose LIPS might Sink Ships&quot; (1941)*
&lt;<A HREF="http://digital.hagley.org/posterexhibit_054?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=b900b71bfd3ad802b209&amp;solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&amp;solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=4">http://digital.hagley.org/posterexhibit_054?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=b900b71bfd3ad802b209&amp;solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&amp;solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=4</A>&gt;


*Glenn Grohe, &quot;HE'S WATCHING YOU&quot; (1942)
&lt;<A HREF="https://www.nh.gov/nhsl/ww2/ww57.html">https://www.nh.gov/nhsl/ww2/ww57.html</A>&gt;*

*Frederick Siebel, &quot;SOMEONE TALKED!&quot; (1942)*
&lt;<A HREF="https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18612741/">https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/18612741/</A>&gt;

*Credit cards don't respect our financial privacy. Our credit card
purchases are used by marketers to target us. The original cryptocurrency,
Bitcoin, respects financial privacy more than credit cards, but because all
Bitcoin transactions are publicly available for anyone to see, Bitcoin
still puts our financial privacy at risk. Payment systems like credit cards
and Bitcoin are &quot;talkative&quot; about our finances.*

*Zcash, on the other hand, is more like paper cash: it is &quot;quiet&quot;.*
