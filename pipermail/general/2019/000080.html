<PRE>Pay With Zcash
<A HREF="https://paywithz.cash">https://paywithz.cash</A>
Progress as of May 1, 2019

- Merchants and non-profits that accept Zcash increased from 242 last month to 255 currently.   In one year, the number has grown 10x.  We're starting to see quality merchants that offer practical every-day items like coffee, food, and music in exchange for $ZEC.
- New listings this month:  Crypto Jobs List, Chabad of Humbolt, Liberty Lobby, Jay&#8217;s Jerky, Zero Knowledge Podcast, Zeroconfs Clothing, CryptoLife, Cryptocurrency Posters, We Shop With Crypto, White Mountains Helicopter Tours, Manyverse, Steve Dressler Music, and NJ Swingsets.
- Followed up with many merchants to see if they can still accept Zcash.   Some, like the Seasteading Insitute, have changed management and no longer accept Zcash, therefore they have been removed from the directory.   There's nothing more frustrating than a directory that is outdated or leads users astray.
- Worked on SEO.   The site is the #1 or #2 result in search engines Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo for &#8220;pay with Zcash&#8221; and also near the top for &quot;spend Zcash&quot; and &quot;where to spend Zcash.&quot;
- Pay With Zcash was linked to on the [Electric Coin Company's Spend Zcash](<A HREF="https://z.cash/spend-zcash/">https://z.cash/spend-zcash/</A>) page and mentioned in Elise's excellent ECC article [Zcash Enables Charitable Giving](<A HREF="https://z.cash/blog/zcash-empowers-charitable-giving/">https://z.cash/blog/zcash-empowers-charitable-giving/</A>).

Worked on SEO.   The site is at the top or #2 when you search Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo for &#8220;pay with zcash&#8221;.
Thanks,
Eric Vaughn
