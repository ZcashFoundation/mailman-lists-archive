Dear Community members,


Just brief update from the Coincentrix Team. We are moving forward into the accordance with the schedule we have laid out in the grant.

Since the beginning of the year planning and workshop material have been created to meet the goals of the project. We have chosen 4 pilot schools with a possibility of 2 additional schools. Also we are doing a joint presentation with a local non profit organization in Birmingham Alabama at the town public library to reach awareness to local community members and college students.We have our first order of Zcash foundation shirts to arrive as well as identified ambassadors at the 4 chosen schools to start the organizing of the events.

This month we have had calls with Andrew and Linda from Guarda to discuss points on the development of their ZCASH wallet and also  Josh Cincinnati to discuss our project progress, next steps and technical overview. In Birmingham Alabama this month we have 2 back to back presentations at University of Alabama Birmingham and Bessemer Public Library. We invited 2  local experts in the crypto space to come speak regarding mining and investments to involve local blockchain entrepreneurs and businesses. We believe local involvement by blockchain entrepreneurs, businesses and  enthusiasts is the key success tool to spread massive grassroots adoption of Zcash.

For February we are on the active pursuit to push Zcash adoption sticking to our schedule and involving all fundamental parts of the blockchain ecosystem. We are scheduled to have calls with Jason davis and radix to get additional highlights on our presentation material as well as engage actively in the Zcash community.


I'll put all valuable updates here as well as Zcash forums to actively in the Zcash community!

February 2018 Zcash Foundation Update
=====================================

Dear ZcF General Subscribers,

In an effort to provide greater visibility into the Zcash Foundation,
I'll be writing end-of-the-month updates on our work by posting to
this list. Attempting a monthly cadence, but may adjust as we learn.

Without further adieu, here are the updates for the month of February,
in no particular order:

I was appointed Executive Director, in addition to preparing and
presenting a vision/roadmap doc to the Board. More info in the blog
post: https://z.cash.foundation//blog/exec-director-and-roadmap/ I'm
really excited to represent the Zcash Foundation and looking forward
to our work this year.

Powers of Tau continues! It's been coordinated on a Foundation mailing
list, though all credit for organizing and maintaining goes to Sean
Bowe and Jason Davies. There's still time to participate?if you're
interested, join the mailing list here:
https://lists.z.cash.foundation/pipermail/zapps-wg/ and request to
participate.

We are beginning the planning process for the 2018Q2 grant program. We
have $125k slated for the program this time around, but the amount may
be increased with some outside support. Draft Q2 grant process
available here:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/tree/draft.
Feedback is most welcome!

Additionally, we have encouraged 2017Q4 grant recipients to post their
updates to this list; Guarda and Coincentrix have been quite
communicative either here or on GitHub?other grant receivers, if
you're reading this, please consider posting. ;)

We have been diligently planning Zcon0?our first conference, and what
we're hoping will be the preeminent event on privacy technology in
cryptocurrencies. It's June 25th-28th in Montreal, and if you're
interested attending, the application is available here:
https://z.cash.foundation//zcon/

As part of the Zcon0, we're going to certify votes from the community
to determine new board members and elect (or reject) current board
members. There's long discussion on the governance issue available
here: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/56 ,
but at the conclusion of that debate Zcash Foundation Board Chairman
Andrew Miller posted this governance election proposal:
https://github.com/amiller/ZcashFoundation/blob/election/election-proposal.md
. As you might have guessed by now, feedback is very much welcome,
either here or on GitHub!

We've been actively pursuing hires for protocol development, web
contracting, and communications?either full time or contractors.
Pertinent GitHub Issues here:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/53
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/54 . If you
have any interest, please reach out to me directly (this address: josh
[at] z.cash.foundation).

Thanks all,

Josh Cincinnati
Executive Director, Zcash Foundation

Snippets of the 3 events completed.


UAB & Bessmer Public Library:


On February 22nd, we held an event that proved exciting and highly informative. We managed to collaborate with Siamese Dreams (a local non-profit), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Alabama Power. While at the University of Alabama Birmingham, experienced crypto experts came from across the state. Our speakers included Tyler Frost and Matthew Rizzio, who partnered with us to educate and relay their experiences within the space, as well as their individual interactions with Zcash. The crowd was relevant and alert, since it consisted of Alabama Power Engineers and students that showcased their interest by submitting survey data both preceding and following the event. Our full and complete debrief will be available end of month via Medium, Linkedin and Steemit. The Bessemer Public Library event was also a new experience since it exposed Zcash to a rural area of Birmingham, Alabama. Our survey data compared across regions emphasized that more outreach is necessary in often overlooked outskirts like these. We were continually told this was the first time individuals at the Bessemer Public Library had seen or heard of Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Zcash.

Howard University:


On March 30th, we held a successful event in collaboration with the African Business Club and Howard Blockchain Labs. Hosted in Annex Seminar Room, the crowd and audience was very much engaged with the privacy aspects of Zcash and the impact of Blockchain technology in Africa. Howard is a Historical Black College University (HBCU) and the Eventbrite link also managed to attract local cryptocurrency enthusiasts that did not attend the college. Students and community members actively engaged by also submitting survey data both preceding and following the event.


After the event, surveys show the majority had an increased interest in utilizing Zcash while investing, even favoring Zcash over more popularized cyrptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Our full and complete debrief will also be available end of month via Medium, LinkedIn and Steemit.

In April, we have multiple events planned in both Nashville, Tennessee and Huntsville, Alabama. Currently, we have speaking events at Alabama A&M and Tennessee State University (TSU), as well as a community event in Nashville. This event will be hosted at Pluckerz, a local favored chicken restaurant that caters to millennials. After exposing this business to cryptocurrency and blockchain, the restaurant has now decided to enlist Zcash as a form of payment within the store for clients. This event will celebrate this addition to their payments platform and mark the beginning of Zcash purchases following the event. Plucerz serves as a direct example of our local strategy to promote buy-in from small businesses and expose them further to Zcash. Throughout this process, we will also make sure to update the MineZcash list for businesses accepting Zcash.


Please find attached samples of data we are currently analyzing to form a debrief outlining preceding and post-event insights, in addition to pictures and media resulting from the events.

On April 26th, 2018 we were invited by Dr. Chance Glenn the Dean of the College of Engineering at Alabama A&M University to participate and provide a 1-hour presentation on Zcash and Blockchain Fundamentals for the Dean Speaker Series. It was an opportunity for residents within Huntsville, AL and other areas of Madison County to share ideas, lessons learned, and listen to important topics from invited speakers within the Southern region. This event was featured as a spotlight on WAFF 48, a local news station, and promoted by Alabama A&M University?s public relations department. This event attracted a crowd of more than 100 people that consisted of faculty, students, and community business and residents. Attendees were excited to be exposed to Zcash and Blockchain technology that led to a lengthy Q&A segment that last an hour. Attendees asked questions such as ?How do you see Zcash be utilized in everyday transactions? ?The Dean Speakers Series concluded with additional conversations about innovation and new opportunities that included integrating Zcash and Blockchain technology into student projects and course material within the College of Engineering. Several faculty members and residents from the community inquired about additional information and future collaborations. Below are several pictures from the Dean Speaker Series.

Sounds like an excellent event! Oyedeji, is there video by any chance?

Also, I should introduce myself to the list. I'm Sonya Mann, newest
employee of the Zcash Foundation. I'll be running communications. In the
future, anyone who's organizing an event like this should definitely reach
out and I'll do what I can to help promote!

Cheers,
Sonya

Hello everyone! In case you haven't met me yet, my name is Sonya Mann. I'm
the Zcash Foundation's third employee and new Communications Manager
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/welcome-sonya/>.

I'll be the person writing and sending these updates going forward. My
apologies that this one is late ? it was supposed to go out on Friday, but
hopefully you wouldn't have read your email until Monday anyway ?

Aside from hiring me, here's what the Zcash Foundation did in May:

Grants Program
We continued to spread the word of our Grants Program
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/q2-grant-program/>, which had an initial
deadline of May 18. Ultimately we received 41 pre-proposals
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues> (roughly
10 more than last year
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2017Q4/issues>). So far, 22
applicants
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ainvited-full>
have been invited to submit full proposals.

Updates on the last round of grant projects are due in June. We've reminded
the recipients, and hope to see a handful of their faces at Zcon0. Speaking
of which...

Zcon0
Planning and promotion for our first conference
<https://z.cash.foundation//zcon/>, which takes place in late June, are
ongoing. There is a list of confirmed speakers
<https://z.cash.foundation/zcon/speakers/>, but we're still nailing down
the exact agenda. Merchandise orders have either gone out or will be going
out this week.

Governance
We are doing direct outreach to increase participation in our Community
Governance Panel
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/elections#the-community-governance-panel>
(which Executive Director Josh Cincinnati blogged about in April
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/zcon0-and-community-governance/>).
Currently there are 54 participants on the list
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/governance_panel.md>
.

Nine people have self-nominated to join the Foundation's Board of
Directors, as you can see on GitHub
<https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/elections/pulls>.

The current deadline for ballot proposals is June 8. At least one of them
will address the question of ASIC mining. On that subject...

ASIC Debate
On May 8 the Foundation released a statement on ASIC resistance
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/statement-on-asics/>, in light of
Bitmain's new Equihash-oriented ASIC miner
<https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020180516100211649AUOpGcK4066D>.
How to approach ASIC resistance, or whether resistance is worthwhile at
all, has generated a great deal of contentious discussion. You can get a
taste on the forum
<https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353>.

The Foundation has already contracted researchers to search for evidence of
Zcash stealth mining. Expect an update on their findings sometime soon.

Miscellaneous
The Foundation is actively recruiting for technical hires, and we have a
couple of excellent candidates in the pipeline. Our current expectation is
that we'll move forward with offers after Zcon0.

On May 26 the Foundation organized a low-key gathering
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/east-bay-meetup/> in the SF Bay Area, in
partnership with community member Howard Loo.

The End
That's all, folks! Feedback on the format and contents of these monthly
updates is very welcome. Would you like more details? Less? Let me know!

Subject: [ZcF-general] Study: Detecting ASIC Miners in Zcash
Message-ID: <CAOztXWjA=AwmjYKiHHBagvY9BkHPDBGfhtO3OOcAJi9e_--E6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody! I'm cross-posting from our announcement blog post:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/asic-equihash-study/

The Zcash Foundation asked University of Luxembourg researchers Alex
Biryukov and Daniel Feher to investigate the potential presence (now or in
the past) of ASIC miners in the Zcash and Equihash ecosystems. This is the
first step in addressing the commitments we made in our official statement
<https://z.cash.foundation//blog/statement-on-asics/> on the ASIC
resistance debate. Today we are jointly releasing the results; the full
report is available on their website
<https://cryptolux.org/images/e/ef/Zcash_Mining.pdf>.

Biryukov and Feher concluded, ?In the short period of time of this study (2
weeks) we could put an upper bound on the ASIC/FPGA potential presence in
Equihash mining ecosystem as of end of May 2018 at 20 ? 30% of total mining
operations,? based on GPU miner?s dev-fee estimates and the fraction of
above 8Ksol miners in the Equihash mining landscape. Dev fees are typically
2% voluntary fees that many of the GPU miners pay to the developers of the
most optimized GPU mining software.

To be clear, that means that *if* ASIC operations were active in the
Equihash ecosystem, they did not comprise more than 20 ? 30% of total hash
power.

Biryukov and Feher continued, ?Most of the mining power (95%) is
concentrated in pools so any large hidden ASIC/FPGA operation should be
present in one or several of the pools, moreover four pools concentrate
87.5% of the total mining power.?

The researchers made sure to include a caveat: ?It is important to note
that our current methods can be ?fooled? by careful ASIC miner and the
methods are also not fine-grained enough to detect ASIC miner testing of
few % of the total hash-rate. This is a work for further research.?

We encourage you to read the study
<https://cryptolux.org/images/e/ef/Zcash_Mining.pdf> yourself, as well as
the ballots <https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/pulls> that will
be part of our upcoming governance process.

Hello everyone! June was a hectic month for the Foundation. In the best
possible way ? but I think we're all looking forward to a calmer July.
Anyway, here's everything we did in June:

ASICs

As background, hopefully you've read the official statement on ASIC
resistance that we published in May:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/statement-on-asics/

Making good on our promises, in June the Foundation co-released a study
conducted by University of Luxembourg researchers Alex Biryukov and Daniel
Feher, which examined the presence of Equihash ASIC miners:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/asic-equihash-study/

Not long after that, the Foundation issued an open request to miner
manufacturers, outlining the transparency we'd like to see from them:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hardware-transparency/

We plan to circle back on the results of that request sometime in the
coming months. Exact date TBD.

Grants

The Grant Review Committee invited 23 candidates to submit full proposals:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ainvited-full

All but two have done so. Stay tuned for further decisions from the
Committee!

Updates from the previous round of grantees will be shared in July. The
format is TBD; this may be a Foundation blog post or it may be part of Eran
Tromer's program report. Perhaps both. Either way, we'll let you know on
Twitter and in the next edition of this email.

Governance

Our experimental community governance process went forward in June, thanks
to heroic effort from Executive Director Josh Cincinnati. Here's how the
process worked, and the spirit in which we conducted it:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections

The list of people who voted:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/governance_panel.md

And what they were voting on:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/governance-voting/

Many participants told us that the governance process was confusing. (The
fact that I had to list three separate links above is indicative of our UX
problems.) A handful of would-be participants said that it was not
announced widely enough.

On the bright side, one person noted that they were impressed by how many
people voted despite these issues! The 88.88% turnout is mostly thanks to
Josh "getting out the vote," so to speak, by repeatedly emailing Panel
members.

On the even brighter side, we've already conducted detailed postmortems,
both with the Zcash Foundation Board and a larger group. We have a good
idea of what ought to be changed next time (although more feedback is still
welcome). Expect much greater clarity and streamlining during our next
round of governance!

The actual results were announced at Zcon0. You can review the full details
here:
https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/cdc15aa6-6f75-11e8-b5e0-0e48ec97cebb/view

Foundation Chairman Andrew Miller got on stage to walk Zcon0 attendees
through the proposals and results: https://youtu.be/m8gv8rvcV08

In a concurrent meeting, Naval Ravikant and Yan Zhu stepped down from the
Board, while new members Ian Miers and Amber Baldet were unanimously
approved to join. We are thrilled to have them on board (pun intended), and
we are grateful to Naval and Yan for their service.

As for the other ballot proposals, the Foundation plans to release a
detailed statement outlining our response(s) to the Panel's decisions on
Tuesday the 3rd (tomorrow). You'll find it on our blog:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hardware-transparency/

Our direction will be influenced by the Board discussion that took place on
June 28th:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/blob/master/board-documents/minutes/2018-06-28.md

Zcon0

The conference was a triumph (and it's not bragging for me to say that,
because personally I did close-to-zero planning). The whole Zcash community
has taken the #BUIDL meme to heart, and we could not be more appreciative.

If you attended, hopefully you heard Operations Director Antonie Hodge
congratulated several times, but she deserves at least one more shoutout.
Thank you also to Paige Peterson from the Zcash Company, and of course our
Executive Director Josh Cincinnati, for doing substantial work alongside
Antonie. And on top of that, much love to the many speakers and workshop
leaders who shared their expertise and wisdom!

Check out a few of the highlights on Twitter:
https://twitter.com/search?q=zcon0&src=typd

All of the talks were livestreamed, and can be watched on our YouTube page:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40dyJ0UYTLK507afWUMgzUYeh-i4qQWS

HD versions are coming soon. Ryan Taylor from the Zcash Company took
ownership of handling the live video and he did a fantastic job!

Workshop notes are available on GitHub:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcon0-workshop-notes

Final Tidbits

The Freedom of the Press Foundation now accepts donations in $ZEC, and
plans to support shielded transactions soon!

Hello everyone! I hope you're having a lovely August so far. Apologies for
the delay in sending this email ? I was tied up with the Decentralized Web
Summit last week. But I'll tell you about that next month in the August
recap :)

After a very eventful June, the Foundation spent July getting our feet back
under us. There's a lot going on internally that we're not ready to
announce, except in broad strokes: We're continuing to work on hiring,
technical partnerships, the grants program, and an overhaul of our web
presence.

Notable July events:

? On the 3rd, we published the Foundation's interpretation of the results
from our governance process, including thoughts on how to improve it next
time: https://z.cash.foundation//blog/governance-results/

? On the 10th, we weighed in on the Zcash Ecosystem Fund controversy:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/founders-reward/

? On the 12th, we published a comprehensive Zcon0 recap with lots of links:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/zcon0-recap/

? On the 26th, we were pleased to see Bitmain take further steps toward
transparency:
https://blog.bitmain.com/en/transparency-policy-shipping-mining-practices/

Bitmain's announcement is worth including because it was formulated, at
least in part, as a response to our June request that hardware
manufacturers start sharing more metrics:
https://z.cash.foundation//blog/hardware-transparency/ (we know this for
certain from conversations with Bitmain staff)

A few additional items from the wider world of Zcash...

Billy Garrison blogged about how and why to participate in the Sapling MPC:

1)
https://medium.com/@blockchainbilly/participating-in-the-zcash-sapling-mpc-8fdbe89d8838

2)
https://medium.com/@blockchainbilly/what-is-the-zcash-sapling-mpc-ceremony-8b9c29e4c7c6

BitGo added Zcash support! "BitGo isn't a run-of-the-mill ZCash
implementation ? this is the FIRST multi-signature ZCash wallet. Technical
folks will know that multi-sig in ZCash is different from other blockchains
and it does affect privacy. But finally ? a secure platform for ZCash is
here!" ? BitGo CEO Mike Belshe:
https://twitter.com/mikebelshe/status/1022128951693459456

Coinbase might add support for $ZEC, a possibility summed up in a Zcash
Company blog post: https://blog.z.cash/coinbase-exploring-zcash/

Reply to this email if you have any specific questions and I'll be happy to
provide whatever additional details I can! Thank you.

Hello everyone! Happy Labor Day / International Workers' Day to all of you.
If you had a long weekend, I hope you enjoyed it.

August was a heads-down month for the Zcash Foundation, so this update will
be on the shorter side. Two items from previous months that are still in
progress, moving forward but not finished:

   - Technical hiring.
   - Website overhaul.
   - Finalizing the grants.

Speaking of those last two, we have a handy grants page now:
https://z.cash.foundation/grants/

While you're at it, sign up for our new proper newsletter:
https://buttondown.email/zcashfoundation

(I don't plan to replicate content between this list and that one. And
don't worry, we'll have our own URL for the newsletter archives before
long. I didn't want to wait to start gathering contact info, since email is
such a powerful marketing channel.)

Meanwhile, Antonie has been preparing the financial audit of 2017. She has
also undertaken early planning for Zcon1. We're not ready to announce
concrete details, but potential attendees will get much more advance notice
this year.

I've been primarily focused on meetups, collaborating with Paige from the
Zcash Company. I got to meet the New York and Sacramento volunteers in
person this month, which was illuminating.

The Foundation has an umbrella network on Meetup.com now:
https://meetup.com/pro/zcash-foundation

If you're in LA, go hang out and talk about Sapling on the 22nd:
https://www.meetup.com/lazcash/events/254133917/

And if you're near Boston, go to the Sapling activation party that Neal
Jayu is hosting in October!
https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Zcash-Users-Group/events/253859408/

Paige and I hope to get more Sapling activation parties rolling.

We've written an in-depth guide for organizers that is almost ready to
publish. It's just waiting on a couple of design elements.

Some miscellaneous items:

   - A discussion of Bitmain's transparency policy, and whether it's good
   enough, on the forum:
   https://forum.z.cash/t/bitmains-transparency-policy-over-zcash-asics-ended-after-just-one-month-and-nobody-even-noticed/30886
   - "Decentralized funding? An analysis of three programs" by Nadia
   Eghbal, which includes the Zcash Foundation:
   https://nadiaeghbal.com/grant-programs
   - BOLT! https://twitter.com/ja_akinyele/status/1029550602404200454
   - The Foundation helped sponsor the Zero Knowledge Summit, which is
   happening this week in Berlin: http://www.zeroknowledge.fm/summit

As usual, please let me know if you have any questions.

Hello everyone, and happy October! Here's a snappy update on the
Foundation's September doings.

We took over the Zcash forum and the chat:
https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/forum-handover-url-change/31168

We sponsored the Zero Knowledge Summit in Berlin. Check out the videos from
the event:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4eYj_tPcTU&list=PL3bvPCw5QCLK0B6tN7LtAjRdVOstQSiU8

The Foundation also sponsored Crypto Springs in Palm Springs (in fact, Josh
is attending right now).

We launched a full guide to running Zcash meetups:
https://z.cash.foundation/meetups/

Unveiled our new visual branding:
https://twitter.com/ZcashFoundation/status/1040691595341848576

Announced an upcoming meetup during SF Blockchain Week:
https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/255001807/

The Foundation also continued to work on technical hiring. A couple of
favored candidates fell through, unfortunately, but we're pursuing multiple
proposals for reference wallet implementations (both on mobile and
desktop). We still want to hire a protocol developer, so please send this
link to anyone who might be interested:
https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/ZcashFoundation/issues/74

We started fleshing out the new website, which will be more organized and
accessible ? see the WIP here:
https://github.com/RichardLitt/zcashfoundation.github.io

We started brainstorming a revamped, nimbler Grants Program. Details are
still being figured out.

And lastly, Antonie is still doing early planning for Zcon1. We hope to
announce a location soon!

Happy November, friends! In chronological order, here's how the Zcash
Foundation spent its time during October ???????

We contributing to sponsoring Crypto Springs, a conference in Southern
California. Executive Director Josh Cincinnatti attended.

We held a successful meetup during SF Blockchain Week. The presentations
were not recorded, but here's a snapshot of Alejandro Machado as he
described his research on Zcash usage in Venezuela:
https://twitter.com/ZcashFoundation/status/1050224386060382208

We published a blog post with updates from the previous round of grant
winners, and included a brief note on the delay in announcing the next
round: https://z.cash.foundation/blog/update-on-grants/

That brief note is important enough to excerpt here:

> You may be wondering what on earth is going on with our Grants Program.
We know that this answer is unsatisfying, but we?re dealing with internal
delays and figuring out how to address the process deficiencies for future
programs.

> Our plan for Q4 and beyond is to switch to a more lightweight, nimble
funding option. The Grants Program has produced excellent work, but the
Foundation wants to accelerate that progress and improve our ability to
support the Zcash ecosystem.

Later in the month, we hosted a Sapling celebration livestream that
featured Q&A with Zcash Company engineers and other staff:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtIYLqHfbSk

Here's the most exciting item on the list! We announced a technical
partnership with Parity Technologies to build an independent Zcash node
implementation. Many more details in our press release:
https://z.cash.foundation/blog/parity-partnership/

Parity's blog post:
https://medium.com/paritytech/parity-teams-up-with-zcash-foundation-for-parity-zcash-client-cca8a47e18f3

CoinDesk coverage: https://www.coindesk.com/parity-zcash-crypto/

At the very end of the month, Executive Director Josh Cincinnati spoke at
Devcon4, as did Ian Miers, who is on the Zcash Foundation Board. We're
developing blog posts based on both talks.

You can watch a recorded livestream of Josh's talk at this link, just
navigate to the 5:43:00 timestamp:
https://slideslive.com/38911452/devcon4-day2

The timestamp of Ian's talk has yet to be unearthed, but you can watch a
previous version that he presented at Scaling Bitcoin. Timestamped link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgtF7psIKWg&feature=youtu.be&t=3685

Throughout the month, behind the scenes, we continued conversations about
revamping the Grants Program and coordinating with the Zcash Company on
standards and development work. We also continued evaluating several
potential partnerships that are still too early or tentative to share in
public.

Phew, that's everything! We hope that you all had a happy Sapling
activation and a happy Halloween! As always, feel free to respond to this
email with any questions or comments.

Hello everyone, happy December! We hope that whatever fall or winter
holidays you celebrate have been, and will continue to be, full of joy.

November was certainly a joyful month for the Zcash Foundation. We
announced the winners of the 2018Q2 Grants Program:
https://z.cash.foundation/blog/q2-grant-winners/

We also announced that we're funding Aditya Kulkarni's zec-qt-wallet, a
cross-platform GUI wallet that includes a full node, as well as a new iOS
wallet to be created by Justin Smith:
https://z.cash.foundation/blog/wallet-agreements/

We helped sponsor a zk-proofs workshop in London:
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/free-two-day-zero-knowledge-proof-developer-workshop-hackathon-tickets-52320521087#

And the Foundation is among the sponsors of an upcoming event on Wednesday
called Blockchain Against Evil:
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/blockchain-against-evil-tickets-52069749021
(tickets are still available!)

Last month we wrote: "Throughout the month, behind the scenes, we continued
conversations about revamping the Grants Program and coordinating with the
Zcash Company on standards and development work. We also continued
evaluating several potential partnerships that are still too early or
tentative to share in public." That remains true.

December is likely to be a slow month, but we'll have more exciting news to
share in Q1 and Q2 of 2019.

A question about this monthly summary email: We've been focusing on
tangible public progress that the Zcash Foundation made in a given month.
Would you prefer more operational details? (The operational details tend to
be, "The team sent a lot of emails and did some phone calls," so that might
not be interesting.) News about the general Zcash ecosystem? No guarantees
that we'll shift format, but feedback is welcome!

Subject: [ZcF-general] Grant project progress report: platform for zcash
 blockchain analysis
Message-ID: <ab08af29-e284-b08e-fd1c-f346a6e9c887@pwr.edu.pl>

Dear All,

In this e-mail we would like to update you on the progress of the tool
for zcash blockchain analysis platform (GrantProposals-2018Q2, grant
proposal #39).

Firstly, we established a dedicated repository for the tool (called
"Dru"): https://github.com/bergplace/Dru.

Secondly, we made a decision that Dru will consist from two layers:
- block-engine devoted for obtaining and block storage in a database
- frontend that will be responsible for interaction with the user (API,
handling requests, messaging)

This will allow to obtain and run only a docker image of the
block-engine for those who have different ideas for the use of the
system, not related to the frontent/API. Of course, in the grant project
we will deliver both layers.

We successfuly moved and abstracted the blockchain layer and as for now
the block-engine is capable of working with zcash.

We also await the security recommendations of the security expert who
joined and evaluates the project idea.

Apart from that we started to work on the documentation of the project.

Greetings,
Radoslaw Michalski & team
