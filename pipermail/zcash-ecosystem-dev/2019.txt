Hi all,

In line with our domain switchover from z.cash.foundation to zfnd.org (more
info here: https://www.zfnd.org/blog/website-refresh/ ) the mailing lists
have been renamed. Our mailing lists are now served and archived via:

/

And you can email to the zcash-ecosystem-dev list via:

zcash-ecosystem-dev at lists.zfnd.org

We set up a 301 Redirect to old archives so old links should work; if you
find a case that doesn't, please email me directly to let me know.

Thanks,
Josh

 Draft ZIPs
Message-ID: <CA+-Lzu-TTzuh9N9caxupWAB+JnAvMTf5Z-DHEoaJqTNWN_h=fg@mail.gmail.com>

There are a few Draft ZIP that we (the ZIP Editors, myself and Daira) would
like to see more discussion on before merging. You can find them here:

Draft ZIP 210: https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/212
Draft ZIP 308: https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/197 (note that this ZIP
is nearly complete, but still has an open comment for implementation:
https://github.com/zcash/zips/pull/197#issuecomment-475906130)

Additionally, I expect we will have more ZIP PRs open for comment after
this weekend with the NU3 deadline coming up on March 31st, but I will
reach out to this list and the forum for more comments shortly.

Thanks,
Josh

I have also published a draft ZIP for NU3 for avoiding address
linkability against an attacker that can break the zk-SNARK.

Hi Everyone!

I wanted to provide a point of clarification on how to find the text of the
ZIP Drafts for the ZIPs listed above. When you click on the links listed in
my previous email, it will take you to a PR in GitHub. If you move over to
"Files Changed" near the top of the PR, you can read the text of the ZIPs.

Thanks!
